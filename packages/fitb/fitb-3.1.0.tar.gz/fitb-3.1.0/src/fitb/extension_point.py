"""Define a simple system of extension-points and extensions.

An extension-point represents a point in a program that can be extended. It comprises a name and a collection of
extensions at that point. Each extension on an extension-point provides a specific "implementation" for that
extension-point.

Extensions themselves comprise a name, a description, a sequence of configurable options, and a method for "activating"
them. This activation produces the object that actually embodies the implementation of the extension.
