    Reverts the fix to the ``idrac`` hardware type creating port objects
    during inspection with ``pxe_enabled`` fields not set to reflect the
    configuration of the physical ports. It is inconsistent with the stable
    branch policy [1]. It requires ``python-dracclient`` version 1.5.0 and
    greater; however, ``driver-requirements.txt`` specifies version 1.3.0 and
    greater can be used on this branch.
