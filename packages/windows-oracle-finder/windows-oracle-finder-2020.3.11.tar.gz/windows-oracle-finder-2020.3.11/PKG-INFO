Description: # Windows Oracle Finder
        
        "Windows Oracle Finder" is a module for python scirpts in order to find the correct version of the "Oracle Client" or "Oracle Instant Client" to use.
        
        ## Purpose
        
        The purpose of this module is not to be deployed to live system like webservers or similar. Following the guidelines of the oracle connection modules (like [cx_Oracle](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/)) is strongly recommended.
        
        This module is intended for use in scripts that are running on different client machines, that the oracle installation could be different in each one or has many oracle installations.
