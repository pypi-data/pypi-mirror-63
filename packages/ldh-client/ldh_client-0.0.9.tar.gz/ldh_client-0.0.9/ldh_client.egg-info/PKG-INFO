        *Liberty CLI* is a user-facing command-line client for interacting
        with Librem One or another Liberty Deckplan Host (LDH).
        
        Dive into https://liberty.one for LDH design and development.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The preferred way to install Liberty CLI is with your package
        manager. The recommended package name is `ldh-client`. For example:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt install ldh-client # Debian-based
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        pipx install ldh-client # Python-based
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        For help and a list of available commands:
        
        ```bash
        liberty --help
        ```
        
        To add a tunnel connection to Network-Manager:
        
        ```bash
        liberty setup tunnel
        # you will be prompted for your Librem One/LDH credentials
        ```
        
        ## Installation (from source)
        
        If you'd prefer to run from source...
        
        1. Install Python 3.x and pipenv. (See
           <https://docs.pipenv.org/install/> for a tutorial.)
        
        2. Install prerequisites:
        
                apt install libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libssl-dev python3-dev
        
        3. Get source:
        
                git clone https://source.puri.sm/liberty/tool/client.git ldh_client
        
        4. Install with pipenv:
        
                cd ldh_client
                pipenv install --dev -e .
        
        ## Usage (from source)
        
        ```bash
        cd ldh_client
        pipenv run liberty --help
        # using "pipenv run" avoids confusing the package and source installations
        ```
        
        ## Build wheel package (and optionally upload)
        
        Follow these instructions to build Liberty CLI as a Python package:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://source.puri.sm/liberty/tool/client.git ldh_client
        cd ldh_client
        pipenv install --dev
        pipenv shell
        # optionally edit default.strict.yaml
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        If everything works as expected you should end up with the files:
        
        * `dist/ldh_client-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`
        * `dist/ldh_client-<version>.tar.gz`
        
        You can now optionally upload the created Python package to PyPI using twine:
        
        ```bash
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
