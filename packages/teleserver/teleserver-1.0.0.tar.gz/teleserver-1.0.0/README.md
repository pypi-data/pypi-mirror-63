Once logged in, feel free to use API commands.

## Additional Features

### Server Lookup
Sometimes it's hard to find teleserver's IP.
It's possible to scan specific network, networks attached to specific interface or all networks in the system.
With `teleserver log lookup_server` command you can find IP address to your teleserver.
Possible flags:
* `--network` - Networks that should be searched for teleserver
* `--interface` - Name of the interface to search for networks to lookup.

This feature works only for IPv4 addreses.
