Description: Posce
        =====
        
        **Posce** is a note-taking toolkit for your command line. It takes a single directory of plaintext note files and lets you create, edit, manipulate, and organise them to your heart's content.
        
        - See [changes.md][ch] for a complete changelog.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Posce required [Python 3.8][py] or higher. To install, you can:
        
        - Run `pip install posce`, or
        - Download the [latest release][re].
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Posce only requires two environment variables to be set:
        
        ~~~bash
        # The path to your notes directory.
        POSCE_DIR = "~/notes"
        
        # The extension your note files use (no dot).
        POSCE_EXT = "txt"
        ~~~
        
        On macOS and Linux, these variables can be set in your shell profile script, most likely `$HOME/.profile`. On Windows, you can set them in the "Environment Variables" subscreen in System Properties (search "environment" in your Start Menu).
