Description: jvm
        ===
        
        Python bridge for the Java Virtual Machine.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
          | |package_bold| is a bridge between Python and JVM, allowing these to intercommunicate.
          | It is an effort to allow Python programs full access to Java class libraries.
        
          `PyPI record`_.
        
          | |package_bold| package is closely based on the **jni** package (Python's lightweight package, based on the *ctypes* or *cffi* library).
        
        
        What is |package|:
        ------------------
        
          |package_bold| is an effort to allow Python programs full access to Java class libraries.
          This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython has done, but rather
          through interfacing at the native level in both virtual machines.
        
          Eventually, it should be possible to replace Java with python in many, though not all,
          situations. JSP, Servlets, RMI servers and IDE plugins are good candidates.
        
          Once this integration is achieved, a second phase will be started to separate the Java
          logic from the Python logic, eventually allowing the bridging technology to be used
          in other environments, I.E. Ruby, Perl, COM, etc ...
        
        
        Known Bugs/Limitations :
            * Java classes outside of a package (in the <default>) cannot be imported.
            * Because of lack of JVM support, you cannot shutdown the JVM and then restart it.
            * Some methods rely on the "current" class/caller. Since calls coming directly from
              python code do not have a current class, these methods do not work. The User Manual
              lists all the known methods like that.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Prerequisites:
        
        + Python 3.6 or higher
        
          * https://www.python.org/
          * 3.7 is a primary test environment.
        
        + pip and setuptools
        
          * https://pypi.org/project/pip/
          * https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/
        
        To install run:
        
        .. parsed-literal::
        
            python -m pip install --upgrade |package|
        
        To ensure everything is running correctly you can run the tests using::
        
            python -m jvm.tests
