# emeki

This is my first python package published on PyPI.
Install as follows.

```
$ pip install emeki
```

After a successful installation, it can be run from
the command line.

```
$ emeki
```

Alternatively, it can be used as a python library.

```python
from emeki.util import str2bool

b = str2bool("true")
print(b)
```
