        ######
        
        Pynfact is a simple static website generator oriented to chronological
        content, like blogs or websites with historic and sequential data.  It
        allows integration with external scripts, comment engines such as
        Disqus, TalkYard, etc., or Google Analytics...  Theming and
        configuration is possible by editing Jinja2 templates.
        
        :Purpose:        A blog-oriented static website generator
        :Latest version: **1.3.1a2** (2020-03-17)

        Features
        ========
        
        * Input format: Markdown
        * Output format: HTML5
        * Configuration: Jinja2 templates
        * Locale support (``gettext``)
        * Code syntax highlighting (``Pygments``)
        * Atom/RSS feed generation
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * **Python 3**
        * **Markdown**: Python implementation of Markdown
        * **Unidecode**: ASCII transliterations of Unicode text
        * **feedgen**: Feed Generator (Atom, RSS, Podcasts)
        * **Jinja2**: A small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template
          engine written in pure Python
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Run::
        
            $ pip install pynfact
        
        (If your default version of Python is 2.x, maybe you need to type
        ``pip3`` instead of ``pip``)
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The interaction is done by command line.  Only a few commands are
        needed:
        
        #. ``pynfact --init=<myblog>``: Create a folder with all needed content
        #. Go to that directory: ``cd <myblog>``
        #. Configure settings in ``config.yml``, title, name, language...
        #. ``pynfact --build``: Generates the static content
        #. ``pynfact --serve=localhost``: Serves locally to test the results
           (by default at ``localhost:4000``)

        Recent changes
        ==============
        
        * CLI interface with ``argparser`` and more modularized
        * Improve code readability to comply with :PEP:`8` and :PEP:`257`
        * Generate pages slugs as posts, i.e, from the title, not the filename
        * Add logging support using ``logging``
        * Put every page in the same directory: ``pages``
        * Deploy as Python package at PyPI:
          `<https://pypi.org/project/pynfact/>`_
        * Add Esperanto locale (``eo``)
        * Simplify ``Builder``  class constructor, now takes a configuration
          dictionary, sorted semantically
        * Replace ``feedgen`` for ``pyatom`` to generate RSS/Atom syndication
          feeds
        
        Why this name?
        ==============
        
        Granted it will be used on the "web", the word "log" in Latin may be
        translated as *INdicem FACTorum*, hence *InFact* or **-nFact** to be
        more easily pronounceable when prepending the prefix *py-*, an indicator
        of the programming language where it has been developed.
        
        Also, *pyblog*, *pyblic*, *pyweblog* and many other cool names were
        already taken.
