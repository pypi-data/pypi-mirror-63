        Pure python 7-zip implementation
        
        
        Dependency
        ==========
        
        It uses a standard lzma module and its API supported.
        It also uses type definitions introduced in Python3.6.
        
        Minimum required version is Python 3.5.
        
        Version recommendations are:
        
        - CPython 3.7.5, CPython 3.8.0 and later.
        - PyPy3.6-7.2.0 and later.
        
        Following fixes are included in above versions and python3.6 series is not fixed it.
        
        - `BPO-21872`_: LZMA library sometimes fails to decompress a file
        - `PyPy3-3088`_: lzma.LZMADecomporessor.decompress does not respect max_length
        
        .. _`BPO-21872`: https://bugs.python.org/issue21872

        Document
        ========
        
        Here is a readthedocs `manual`_ document.
        
        .. _`manual`: https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can run command script py7zr like as follows;
        
        .. code-block::
        
            $ py7zr l test.7z
            $ py7zr x test.7z
            $ py7zr w target.7z test_dir
        
        
        py7zr is a library which can use in your pyhton application.
        Here is a code snippet how to decompress some file in your applicaiton.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            import py7zr
        
            archive = py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r')
            archive.extractall(path="/tmp")
            archive.close()
        
        
        Here is a code snippet how to produce archive.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            import py7zr
        
            archvie = py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w')
            archive.writeall('./base_dir')
            archive.close()
        
        
        py7zr also support `shutil`  interface.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            from py7zr import pack_7zarchvie, unpack_7zarchive
            import shutil
        
            # register file format at first.
            shutil.register_archive_format('7zip', pack_7zarchive, description='7zip archive')
            shutil.register_unpack_format('7zip', ['.7z'], unpack_7zarchive)
        
            # extraction
            shutil.unpack_archive('test.7z', '/tmp')
        
            # compression
            shutil.make_archive('target', '7zip', 'src')
