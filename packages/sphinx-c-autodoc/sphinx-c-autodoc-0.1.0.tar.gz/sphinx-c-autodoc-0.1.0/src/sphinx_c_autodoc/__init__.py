"""
sphinx_c_autodoc is a package which provide c source file parsing for sphinx.

It is composed of multiple directives and settings:

.. rst:directive:: .. c:module:: filename

    A directive to document a c file.  This is similar to :rst:dir:`py:module`
    except it's for the C domain.  This can be used for both c source files as
    well as c header files.

            parents (list): The list split('.') version of path.

                - The filename without the extension when naked argument is used.
                - Any parents when double colon argument is used. For example
                  structs or unions of `my_struct.field_name` would have a

                no return types, no arguments.
