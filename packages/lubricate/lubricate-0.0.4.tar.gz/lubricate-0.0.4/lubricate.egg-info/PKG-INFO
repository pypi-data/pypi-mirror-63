Lubricate helps you decrease friction when stuck at starting a project, no
matter if it's a scientific analysis or a Python package. It will initialise a
ready-to-use project structure with decent defaults.

# Installation

As easy as

    pip install lubricate

# Usage

Currently there are two types of projects available: `python` and `analysis`.
A `python` project is a fully configured Python package with tests, docs and
CI. An `analysis` is a scientific project.

    lubricate new python foo

## Get started with a new analysis project:

    lubricate new analysis the_analysis
