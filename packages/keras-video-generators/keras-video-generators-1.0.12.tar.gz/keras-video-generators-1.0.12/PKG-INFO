        # Keras Sequence Video generators
        
        This package proposes some classes to work with Keras (included in TensorFlow) that generates batches of frames from video files.
        
        It is useful to work with Time Distributed Layer with Video input (frames). Then you may use GRU or LSTM. 
        See articles:
        
        - [The basics of Video frame as input](https://medium.com/smileinnovation/how-to-work-with-time-distributed-data-in-a-neural-network-b8b39aa4ce00)
        - [Usage of these generators here](https://medium.com/smileinnovation/training-neural-network-with-image-sequence-an-example-with-video-as-input-c3407f7a0b0f)
        
        Example can be seen in [integrated note book](./Example of usage.ipynb).
        To see the example in a proper viewer, [you can use that URL](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/metal3d/keras-video-generators/blob/master/Example%20of%20usage.ipynb).
        
        
        Requirements are:
        
        - Python3 (Python 2 will never been supported)
        - OpenCV
        - numpy
        - Keras
        - TensorFlow (or other backend, not tested)
        
        If you want to compile the package, you need:
        
        - sphinx to compile doc
        - setuptools
        
        # Installation
        
        You can install the package via `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install keras-video-generators
        ```
        
        If you want to build from sources, clone the repository then:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py build
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        The package contains 3 generators that inherits `Sequence` interface. So they may be used with `model.fit_generator()`:
        
        - `VideoFrameGenerator` that will take the choosen number of frames from the entire video
        - `SlidingFrameGenerator` that takes frames with decay for the entire video or with a sequence time
        - `OpticalFlowGenerator` that gives optical flow sequence from frames with different methods (experimental)
        
        Each of these generators accepts parameters:
        
        - `glob_pattern` that must contain `{classname}`, e.g. './videos/{classname}/*.avi' - the "classname" in string is used to detect classes
        - `nb_frame` that is the number of frame in the sequence
        - `batch_size`
        - `transformation` that can be `None` or or ImageDataGenerator to make data augmentation
        - `use_frame_cache` to use with caution, if set to `True`, the class will keep frames in memory (without augmentation). You need **a lot of memory**
        - and many more, see class documentation
