        Why do I need this?
        ===================
        
        Automatic cropping is already possible, `plone.namedfile`_ does already handle this via the ``direction`` parameter::
        
          <img tal:define="scales context/@@images"
               tal:replace="structure python: scales.tag('image',
                            width=1200, height=800, direction='down')"
               />
        
        However it only crops from the top/center of the image,
        so in some ocasions this is not what you want.
        
        ``plone.app.imagecropping`` allows you to select the cropping area manually for each available image scale using the `cropper`_  Javascript library
        
        .. _`plone.namedfile`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.namedfile
        .. _`cropper`: https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper
        
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        There is a view @@croppingeditor available for every content type implementing ``IImageCroppingMarker`` via an object action. There are specific markers for Archetypes and Dexterity based types:
        
        - ``plone.app.imagecropping.dx.IImageCroppingDX``
        - ``plone.app.imagecropping.at.IImageCroppingAT``
        
        The interfaces are implemented by default for Dexterity based ``plone.app.contenttypes`` (Plone 5 or Plone 4.x as addon) ``Image``.
        ``Products.ATContentTypes`` (Plone 4.x) implements it on``ATImage`` and ``ATNewsItem``.
        
        There is also a Dexterity behavior called ``Enable Image Cropping`` which can be applied on custom content types containing at least one image.
        
        The editor view hav a tabbed navigation on the top and two columns:
        
        - Image fields on tabbed navigation.
        - Image scales column on left
        - Cropping editor column on right.
        
        The aspect ratio for the cropping area in the editor is automatically set to the image scale selected by the user.
        
        .. image:: https://raw.github.com/collective/plone.app.imagecropping/master/docs/editor.png
        
        The image stored for this scale gets replaced with the cropped and scaled version.
        This way you can access them as you're used to. For example::
        
          <img tal:replace="structure context/@@images/image/mini" />
        
        This also enables support for richtext editors such as TinyMCE to insert cropped scales into a textfield.
        
        
        Automatic cropping behavior
        ---------------------------
        
        You can use ``direction='down'`` for autocropped scales as usual.
        This package overrides the direction and delivers the cropped scale if it is available.
        
        
        Load editor as overlay
        ----------------------
        
        The editor can also be loaded as an overlay anywhere.
        Just place a link to the ``@@croppingeditor`` url of an image (``<image_base_url>/@@croppingeditor``) and add some javascript. For example::
        
            (function($) {
                $(function() {
                    $("a[href$='@@croppingeditor']").prepOverlay({
                        subtype:'ajax',
                        formselector:'#coords',
                        closeselector:"input[name='form.button.Cancel']"
                    })
        
                    $(document).bind("formOverlayLoadSuccess", function() {
                        imagecropping = new ImageCropping();
                        imagecropping.init_editor();
                    })
                })
            })(jQuery);
        
        TODO: Show how to use with mockup/patterns.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        At ``Plone Site Setup`` under ``Content`` there is a new setting ``Image Cropping``.
        There you can limit the scales to be shown in the cropping editor.
        By default all scales are shown.
        
        You can also set those values in the profile of your (policy)product using
        ``plone.app.registry`` mechanism (file ``registry.xml``).
        
        
        Further Information
        ===================
        
        History
        -------
        
        There has been a need for cropping for a long time and there are lots of addons around that have different ways to achieve this.
        
        There is `plip #10174`_ asking for adding image cropping to plone core which recently got rejected by the FWT.
        The cropping functionality should go into an addon first that also work for dexterity and can be pliped into core.
        
        .. _`plip #10174`: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10174
        
        This package aims to be THE cropping solution for plone that 'just works TM'.
        
        
        Design decisions
        ----------------
        
        * make this package as minimally invasive as possible
        
          - therefore we store the cropped image immediately, so ``plone.namedfile``
            traverser doesn't need to care about cropping
        
          - users can access cropped images the same way as the access scales
            (so it works in richtext editors too)
        
        * support archetypes and dexterity content
        
        * a cropped image gets stored instead of the scaled image.
          if you want back the uncropped image scale you'll need to remove the cropped version
          in the editor
        
        
        Information about changes from version 1.x to 2.0
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        - Plone 5.1 only.
        - New js library `cropper`_.
        - Complete Javascript rewrite using patterns.
        - New editor layout.
        - Save/Remove using Ajax.
        
        Information about changes from version 0.1 to 1.0
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        The marker interface for archetypes changed from
        ``plone.app.imagecropping.interfaces.IImageCropping`` to
        ``plone.app.imagecropping.at.IImageCroppingAT``.
        
        The marker interface for dexterity based types changed from
        ``plone.app.imagecropping.browser.scaling.interfaces.IImageCroppingScale`` to
        ``plone.app.imagecropping.dx.IImageCroppingDX``.
        
        The generic base interface is now
        ``plone.app.imagecropping.interfaces.IImageCroppingMarker``.
        Do not use it directly on your, but use the marker to bind view or other adapters to image-cropping enabled types.
        
        
        Possible extensions / changes for the future
        --------------------------------------------
        
        * allow to mark scales as `auto-croppable` in the imaging controlpanel.
          this enables cropped scales w/o manually defining the cropping area but would require some changes in Plone
          (extend traverser, change controlpanel)
        
        * see also the `issue tracker <https://github.com/collective/plone.app.imagecropping/issues>`_

          [fRiSi]
        
        1.1 (2014-09-13)
        ----------------
        
        - scroll to selected scale in middle column after save.
          [jensens]
        
        - use field names (not ids) in editor view. Slightly better style now.
          [jensens]
        
        - add upgrade step for sane migration from 0.1 to 1.0
          [fRiSi]
        
        1.0 (2014-09-05)
        ----------------
        
        - fixed jcrop image to not scale wrong (!).
          [jensens]
        
        - better initial selection for cropping, also mark scales in left column
          cropped/ uncropped and show uncropped in its default appereance.
          [jensens]
        
        - Fix: Removed registration of Traverse for dexterity types since its
          base class does not support dexterity either.
          [jensens]
        
        - Added subscriber to recreate all scales on copied objects.
          [saily, jensens]
        
        - fixed some glitches in JCrop init process.
          [jensens]
        
        - added dexterity behavior for image cropping.
          [benniboy]
        
        - Major cleanup and split up code and interfaces into Dexterity and Archtypes.
          Also renamed/ moved Interfaces to be used as markers! Attention, in custom
          code minor changes are needed in order to point to the correct interfaces.
          see README for details.
          Also removed some superfluos/unused ``interface=`` passes to methods of
          ``IImageCroppingUtils``.
          [jensens]
        
        - Update Jcrop to version 0.9.12.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Use ``plone.app.robotframework`` instead of writing all keywords from
          scratch. This brings us autologin support for faster robot tests. Rewrite
          tests to test scenarios.
          [saily]
        
        - Drop Plone 4.1 support and tests.
          [saily]
        
        - Cleanup code, align to all coding conventions for Plone.
          Pep8, Flake8, pep3101, sort imports, remove grouped imports, ...
          [saily]
        
        - Cleanup/refactor javascript code, don't define global variables.
          [saily]
        
        - Add coveralls, code-analysis and update travis configuration.
          [saily]
        
        - Check for plone.namedfile not Dexterity. It can be used seperately.
          *If plone.namedfile is used it needs to be at least version 2.0.1*
          [tomgross]
        
        - ``@@croppingeditor`` now displays a message to add croppable scales
          in the controlpanel if there are no croppable scales to show.
          (previously this caused a `SiteError`)
          [fRiSi]
        
        - Rename ``imagecropping_keywords.txt`` to ``keywords.robot`` to allow simple
          reusage in ``plone.app.robotframework``.
          [saily]
        
        - pin zc.buildout=2.1.1 for travis-ci boostrap
