        # Rhapsody
        Python program, based on ProDy, for pathogenicity prediction of human
        missense variants.
        
        ## Install latest published version using pip
        Rhapsody is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). To install Rhapsody,
        please use pip in the terminal:
        ```console
        $ pip install -U prody-rhapsody
        ```
        It might be necessary to manually install the DSSP program, for instance
        by typing on Linux:
        ```console
        $ sudo apt install dssp
        ```
        
        ## Install from source
        Rhapsody is written in pure Python so no local compilation is needed.
        
        To install all needed dependencies, we strongly suggest to use Conda and create
        a new environment with:
        ```console
        $ conda create -n rhapsody python=3 numpy scikit-learn requests pyparsing matplotlib biopython
        $ conda activate rhapsody
        $ pip install prody
        $ conda install -c salilab dssp
        ```
        
        After cloning/forking the Rhapsody repository, you can permanently add the
        repository path to the conda environment with:
        ```console
        $ conda develop path/to/local/repository
        ```
        
        If not using Conda, you can manually install all dependencies and then add
        the repository location to the `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable. For
        example, on Linux simply add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:
        ```console
        export PYTHONPATH="path/to/local/repository/:$PYTHONPATH"
        ```
        
        If you are running on Windows, please follow this
        [tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4855685).
        
        ## Running initial setup
        
        After installation, please run:
        ```console
        import rhapsody as rd
        rd.initialSetup()
        ```
