Description: # ofxstatement-dutch 
        
        This project provides custom
        [ofxstatement](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement) plugins for these dutch
        financial institutions:
        - ICSCards, The Netherlands, PDF (https://icscards.nl/)
        - ING bank, The Netherlands, CSV (https://www.ing.nl/)
        
        `ofxstatement` is a tool to convert a proprietary bank statement to OFX
        format, suitable for importing into programs like GnuCash or Beancount. The
        plugin for ofxstatement parses the bank statement and produces a common data
        structure, that is then formatted into an OFX file.
        
        The PDF is converted using the
        [pdftotext](https://pypi.org/project/pdftotext/) utility.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Preconditions
        
        You have to install the poppler library first, see
        [pdftotext](https://pypi.org/project/pdftotext/)
        
        ### Using pip
        
        ```
        $ pip install ofxstatement-dutch
        ```
        
        ### Development version from source
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/gpaulissen/ofxstatement-dutch.git
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ### Troubleshooting
        
        This package depends on ofxstatement with a version at least 0.6.5. This
        version may not yet be available in PyPI so install that from source like
        this:
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement.git
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Test
        
        To run the tests you can use the py.test command:
        
        ```
        $ py.test
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Show installed plugins
        
        This shows the all installed plugins, not only those from this package:
        
        ```
        $ ofxstatement list-plugins
        ```
        
        You should see at least:

        The following plugins are available:
        
          ...
          nl-icscards      ICSCards, The Netherlands, PDF (https://icscards.nl/)

        ```
