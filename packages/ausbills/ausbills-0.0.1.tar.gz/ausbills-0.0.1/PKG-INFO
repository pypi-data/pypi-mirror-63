        This module had methods for scraping the [Australian Federal Parliament](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Lists/Details_page?blsId=legislation%2fbillslst%2fbillslst_c203aa1c-1876-41a8-bc76-1de328bdb726) website, using _beautiful soup_, and send to separate Senate and House of Representatives Discord channels as embeds that can be called throughout Discord server.
        
        The bills are scraped to get data from upper(senate) and lower house bills are:
        
        ```python
        import ausbills
        ausbills.get_house_bills()
        ausbills.get_senate_bills()
        ```
        
        And can easily be turned into pandas dataframes:
        
        ```python
        df_lower = pd.DataFrame(ausbills.get_house_bills())
        df_upper = pd.DataFrame(ausbills.get_senate_bills())
        ```
