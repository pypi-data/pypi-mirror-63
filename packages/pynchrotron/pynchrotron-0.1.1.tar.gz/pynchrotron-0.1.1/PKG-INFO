        Implements synchrotron emission from cooling electrons. This is the model used in [Burgess et al (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0911-z?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+natastron%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+Astronomy%29&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher). Please cite if you find this code useful for your research.
        
        * This code gets rid of the need for GSL which was originally relied on for a quick computation of the of the synchrotron kernel which is an integral over a  Bessel function. 
        * This code has been ported from GSL and written directly in python as well as accelerated with numba
        * An astromodels function is also supplied for direct use in 3ML.
