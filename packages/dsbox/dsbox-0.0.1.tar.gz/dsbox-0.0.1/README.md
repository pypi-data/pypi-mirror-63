# Data Science Toolbox
It should be easier than it is to access common data analysis, machine learning and statistical tasks and tools.

Hypothesis: Repetitive, regular data science tasks, like data importing, basic data analysis, grouping-agregation, and visualization should have ready-made solutions. Where good ready-made solutions are absent (one key area is Topic Modeling), we can make handy libraries for easy access.

Workback:
- Segregate tasks into distinct categories. <b>Done</b>
- Starter code for Pandas profiler. <b>Done</b>
- Test out on testpypi. Upload to PyPi. <b>WIP</b>
- Put starter Pandas code for grouping, aggregation and plotting (Pandas + Matplotlib)
- NLP tasks (word embeddings, topic modeling)
- Resume work on Topic Modeling library to combine the benefits of NLTK, scikit-learn, Gensim, BERT and XLNet embedding (from Huggingface).
