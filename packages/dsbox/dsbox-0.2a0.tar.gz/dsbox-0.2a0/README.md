# DS Toolbox
It should be easy to access day-to-day data science tasks and tools.
Hypothesis: Complicated, regular data science tasks, like data importing, basic data analysis, grouping-agregation, and visualization should have ready-made solutions. Where good ready-made solutions are absent (one key area is Topic Modeling), we can make handy libraries for easy access.

Workback:
- Segregate tasks into distinct categories
- Starter code for Pandas profiler
- Put starter Pandas code for grouping, aggregation and plotting (Pandas + Matplotlib)
- NLP tasks (word embeddings, topic modeling)
- Resume work on Topic Modeling library to combine the benefits of NLTK, scikit-learn, Gensim, BERT and XLNet embedding (from Higgingface PyTorch).
