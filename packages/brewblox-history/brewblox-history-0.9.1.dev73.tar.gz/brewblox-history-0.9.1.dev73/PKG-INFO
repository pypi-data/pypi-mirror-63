Description: # History Service
        
        The history service is the gatekeeper for the InfluxDB database. It writes broadcasted data, and offers a REST interface for querying the database.
        
        ## Features
        
        ### QueryClient ([influx.py](./brewblox_history/influx.py))
        
        Handles directly querying InfluxDB. API functions eventually call this.
        
        ### InfluxWriter ([influx.py](./brewblox_history/influx.py))
        
        Periodically writes scheduled data points to InfluxDB.
        
        Publicly offers the `write_soon()` function, where data can be scheduled for writing.
        
        ### DataRelay ([relays.py](./brewblox_history/relays.py))
        
        Subscribes to the broadcast exchange on the event bus, and schedules all received data for writing to the database.
        
        By default, it is subscribed to the broadcast exchange specified with the `--broadcast-exchange` commandline argument. Additional subscriptions can be added.
        
        ## REST API
        
        ### subscribe ([influx.py](./brewblox_history/influx.py))
        
        Adds another broadcast subscription. All data received with this subscription is written to InfluxDB.
        
        ### queries ([sse.py](./brewblox_history/sse.py))
        
        Public query API for external clients. Input is sanitized before being passed on to InfluxDB.
        
        ### sse ([sse.py](./brewblox_history/sse.py))
        
        Subscribe to regular updates of database values. The endpoint arguments are comparable to the ones used to get values from `queries`. It will periodically yield newly received data as SSE data.
