"""Include a commitment inside an elliptic curve DSA/SSA signature.

Let c be the commitment value and R a curve point, then

    e = hash(R||c)

is a commitment operation.

When signing, an ephemeral secret key k is generated and its
corresponding curve point R = kG is used. Here, instead of
using (k, R), compute the commitment to c

    e = hash(R||c),

tweak k with e and consequently substistute R with W = (k+e)G = R+eG,
the proceed signing in the standard way, using (k+e, W).

When the committer/signer will reveal R and c,
the verifier will check that

    W.x = (R+eG).x

with e = hash(R||c)) and W.x being known from the signature.
