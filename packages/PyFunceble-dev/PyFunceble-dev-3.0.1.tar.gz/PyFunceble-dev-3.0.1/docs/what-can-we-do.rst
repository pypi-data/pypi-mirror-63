  - ... with the help of an auto saving and database system.
  - Set branch to push the result to for the autosaving system.
  - Set the minimal time before we autosave in order to avoid CI/CD limitation.
  - Set a command to execute at the end of the test.
  - Set the commit message for the autosaving system.
