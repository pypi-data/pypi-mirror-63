History of Dead-Hosts
---------------------

The project started on 3rd March 2017 at `funilrys/dead-hosts`_.

The original idea was to test `Funceble`_ against hosts file in order
to find bugs inside `Funceble`_ but also letting me (@funilrys) have a fewer long hosts file.

On 23rd January 2018, I (@funilrys) decided to shut `funilrys/dead-hosts`_ down, as it became 
impossible to test all members of the project without having to wait weeks, I decided that 
it was time to move to another level.

That was the beginning of `Dead-Hosts`_.

Today `Dead-Hosts`_'s objective is to provide to project/list maintainers or individuals
- with the help of PyFunceble - more information about their favorite project/list or domains, IP or URL.
