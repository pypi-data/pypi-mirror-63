It follows a few rules:\n\n1. The first line is required to be a **title**\n2. The second line might be a **description** or a **variable**\n3. The remaining lines should be **variables**\n\n### Title\n\nThe first line of the block should start with a `#` character, followed by a space. The title value is the remaining text after the `#` and space.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n# Hell Yeah!\n```\n\nIn this case, the title is _Hell yeah!_ (not _# Hell yeah!_).\n\n### Description (_optional_)\n\nIf the second line follows the syntax of a _title_ line, it's text (without the `# `) is considered a _description_ and is used to give more information to the user about the variables from this block.\n\n### Variables\n\nThere are three types of variables:\n\n#### Regular\n\nEach block might one or more variable lines. The syntax requires a _name of variable_ using only capital letters, numbers, or underscore, followed by an equal sign.\n\nWhat comes after the equal sign is _optinal_. This text is considered the default value of this variable.\n\nThe human description of this variable is also _optional_. You can create one by using comment at the end of the line.  That is to say, any text after a sequence of two spaces, followed by the `#` sign and one extra space, is the human description of that variable.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nNAME=\n```\n\nThis is a valid variable line. It has a name (_NAME_), no default value, and no human description. We can add a default value:\n\n```\nNAME=Cuducos\n```\n\nThis is still a valid variable line. It has a name(_NAME_), and a default value (_Cuducos_). Yet, we can add a human description:\n\n```\nNAME=Cuducos  # What is your name?\n```\n\nNow it's a complete variable with a name (_NAME_), a default value (_Cuducos_), and a human description (_What is your name?_)\n\n#### Random values\n\nIf you want to have a variable with a random value, you can set its default value to `<random>` and Createnv will take care of it. Optionally you can specify how long this variable should be with `:int`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nSECRET_KEY=<random>\nTOKEN=<random:32>\n```\n\nThe first line will create a `SECRET_VALUE` with random characters and random length (starting at 64 chars).\n\nThe second line will create a `TOKEN` with random value and with exactly 32 characters.\n\nYou can use the [`--chars-for-random-string` option](#options) to specify which characters to be used.\n\n#### Auto generated\n\nFinally, you can combine existing variables _within the same block_ to create a new variable (without prompting your user to combine them).\n\nFor example, let's say you want to greet someone:\n\n```\nNAME=  # What is your name?\nPERIOD=  # Is it morning, afternoon, or evening?\nGREETING=Good {PERIOD}, {NAME}!\n```\n\nIn this case, Createnv only asks the user for `NAME` and `PERIOD`, and creates `GREETING` automagically.",
