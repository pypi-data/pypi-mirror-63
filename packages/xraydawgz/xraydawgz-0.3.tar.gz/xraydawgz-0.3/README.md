## Background
All crystalline materials in nature have chemical and physical properties strongly dependent on atomic structures
  - Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
    - Limitations: nanosized crystals, intergrowth, and defects
  - Powder X-ray diffraction
    - Limitations: complex structures, multiphasic samples, impurities, peak overlaps
  - Alternatives: electron crystallography (EC), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
    - Requires considerable expertise on the operation of electron microscopes and crystallography

SOLUTION: to use CNN to predict crystal structure from any XRD pattern
  
## Purpose
This project will aim to use CNN to predict the crystal structure of a sample based upon its XRD pattern.
In all cases, the users will inputting the XRD pattern that they obtained into our XRayDawgz, which will return a predicted crystal structure.

## How to install
1. Install tensorflow and keras

    ```conda install tensorflow```

    ```conda install keras```

2. Use the following method to clone repo

   - press the green botton <img src="https://github.com/X-ray-Dawgz/XRayDawgz/blob/master/icon/icon.png" width="80"> at 
the home page of our repo, and choose "Download Zip". 
   
   - unzip the file and you would get the file name "XRayDawgz" in your path.

## Examples and Demos


## How to use our software
1. First, the user needs to prepare the XRD diagram pictures which they want to make the prediction. These pictures need to   
   match our standard to test. 
  
    - The standard size is 379*288pxi
    - the range of the diffraction angle(2Î¸) needs to be 0-80 degree
    - the format of the pictures can be .jpg, .npg, .jpeg, .bmp

2. Next, the user needs to go inside the XRayDawgz/XRayDawgz file, and then import predict

    ```import predict```
    
3. Last, predict.crystal_structure("path_to_the_file_included_image"), you can readily check the path by dragging the file  
   
   into the terminal!

   ```predict.crystal_structure("path_to_the_file_included_image")```
