Description: # COVID19Py
        Python API Wrapper for tracking Coronavirus (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) via https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api
        
        ## Installation
        
        In order install this package, simply run:
        
        ```bash
        pip install COVID19Py
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use COVID19Py, you first need to import the package and then create a new instance:
        
        ```python
        import COVID19Py
        covid19 = COVID19Py.COVID19()
        ```
        
        ### Getting latest amount of total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries:
        
        ```python
        latest = covid19.getLatest()
        ```
        
        ### Getting all locations:
        
        ```python
        locations = covid19.getLocations()
        ```
        
        or:
        
        ```python
        locations = covid19.getLocations(timelines=True)
        ```
        to also get timelines.
        
        ### Getting location by country code:
        
        ```python
        location = covid19.getLocationByCountryCode("US")
        ```
        or:
        ```python
        location = covid19.getLocationByCountryCode("US", timelines=True)
        ```
        to also get timelines.
        
        ### Getting a specific location (includes timelines by default):
        
        ```python
        location = covid19.getLocationById(39)
        ```
        
        ### Getting all data at once:
        
        You can also get all the available data with one command.
        
        ```python
        data = covid19.getAll()
        ```
        or:
        ```python
        data = covid19.getAll(timelines=True)
        ```
        to also get timelines.
        
        `latest` will be available on `data["latest"]` and `locations` will be available on `data["locations"]`.
        
        ### Getting `latest` deltas:
        
        When using `getAll()`, COVID19Py will also store the previous version of the retrieved data. This allows us to easily see how data changed since the last time we requested them.
        
        ```python
        changes = covid19.getLatestChanges()
        ```
        ```json
        {
            "confirmed": 512,
            "deaths": 16,
            "recovered": 1024
        }
        ```
