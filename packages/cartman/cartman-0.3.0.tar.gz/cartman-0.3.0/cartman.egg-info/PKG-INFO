        *cartman* allows you to create and manage your Trac_ tickets from the
        command-line, without the need to setup physical access to the Trac_
        installation/database or even the need to install a plugin on Trac_.  All you
        need is a Trac_ account.
        
        Examples
        --------
        Create a new ticket, that will open your $EDITOR::
        
            $ cm new
        
        View the content of a ticket::
        
            $ cm view 1514
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        At a minimum you need to create a ``~/.cartman/config`` file with the
        following::
        
            [trac]
            base_url = http://your.trac.install/
            username = tamentis
            password = sitnemat
        
        The password can also be specified through a `TRAC_PASSWORD`
        environment variable, which overrides the above `password` field.
        
        Configuration Options
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Each section represent a site which can be selected using the ``-s``
        command-line argument.  Within each section, the following settings are
        available:
        
        - ``base_url`` - required, defines the URL of your Trac system
        - ``auth_type`` - forces an authentication type, currently available: ``basic``
          (default), ``digest``, ``acctmgr`` or ``none``.
        - ``username`` - required if ``auth_type`` is not ``none``
        - ``password`` - required if ``auth_type`` is not ``none``
        - ``verify_ssl_cert`` - ignore self-signed or invalid SSL certificates if set
          to false.
        - ``editor`` - override the editor defined the ``$EDITOR`` environment
          variable.
        
        
        Command walk through
        --------------------
        
        Report Listing and Search
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Dump a list of tickets on screen, without details::
        
            $ cm report 1
            #142. fix world hunger (bjanin@)
            #159. ignore unpaid rent (bjanin@)
        
        Another way to find ticket is using the search command::
        
            $ cm search dead mouse
            #154. mickey
        
        Ticket View
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        Show all the properties of a ticket::
        
            $ cm view 1
        
        List of Reports
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Get a list of all the available reports with::
        
            $ cm reports
        
        System Properties
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        This will dump on screen all the Milestones, Components, Versions::
        
            $ cm properties
        
        Creating a ticket
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Creating a ticket will work similarly to writing a new email in mutt_, it loads
        your current ``$EDITOR`` and lets you edit the details of the ticket. Assuming
        all the parameters are correct, it will create the ticket as soon as you save
        and exit and return the ticket number. If your ticket does not appear valid
        (missing required field, inexistent Milestone, etc.) *cartman* will stop and
        lists each error and let you return to your editor::
        
            $ cm new
            -- opens your editor --
        
            Found the following errors:
             - Invalid 'Subject': cannot be blank
             - Invalid 'Milestone': expected: Bug Bucket, Release 2, Release 3
        
            -- Hit Enter to return to editor, ^C to abort --
        
        The first parameter to ``cm`` is the owner of the ticket, it populates the
        ``To`` field by default::
        
            $ cm new jcarmack
        
        If your Trac has custom fields, you can use their identifier in the headers,
        e.g.::
        
            story_id: 5123
            iteration: 15
        
        If you specify a template with -t, cartman will look for a matching file in the
        ``~/.cartman/templates`` folder and will use it as a base for your ticket::
        
            $ cm new -t sysadmin
        
        You can define a ``default`` template in this same directory in order to set
        the template used by default (without ``-t``).
        
        Commenting on a ticket
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        Just like creating a ticket, adding a comment is just like mutt_, your current
        ``$EDITOR`` will be loaded on a blank file for you to edit. Upon save and exit,
        *cartman* will commit this new comment and return silently, unless an error
        occurs::
        
            $ cm comment 1
        
        If the comment is short enough to fit on the command line, you may use the
        ``-m`` flag as such::
        
            $ cm comment 1 -m "you forgot to call twiddle()"
        
        View/Set the status of a ticket
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        View the current status of a ticket, and the available statuses::
        
            $ cm status 1
        
        Set a ticket as accepted::
        
            $ cm status 1 accept
        
        If you need to add a comment with this status change, you can use the ``-c``
        flag, it will open your default editor::
        
            $ cm status 1 reopen -c
        
        You may also use the ``-m`` flag to define the comment in-line, without the use
        of an editor::
        
            $ cm status 1 reopen -m "does not work with x = y"
        
        Advanced configuration
        ----------------------
        If you are using vim_ as your default editor, you also might want to add
        email-like syntax highlighting to match the ``.cm.ticket`` extension::
        
            autocmd BufNewFile *.cm.ticket setf mail
        
        If you use multiple Trac sites, you can have multiple configurations in the
        same file using the section to separate the sites, here is an example::
        
            [other]
            base_url = http://other.trac.site/
            username = tamentis
            password = sitnemat
            verify_ssl_cert = False
        
        
        You would pass the ``-s`` parameter to ``cm`` to define which site to access::
        
            cm -s other report 1
        
        You may define all common configuration settings in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section.
        
        Using cartman without editor
        ----------------------------
        You may need to integrate cartman with other software where opening an editor
        does not make sense.  In that case you can automatically create tickets from
        a file using the ``--message-file`` option::
        
            cm new --message-file=secerror.txt
        
        This file would need to contain a complete ticket, if anything is missing,
        cartman will exit with an error message.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Quick and dirty if you are not familiar with Python packaging::
        
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        - Python 2.7+, 3.3+ (not 3.2, not 2.6)
        - python-requests 1.2 and above
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        - Tested on Trac 0.12.5 and 1.2.x
        - Probably still works on 0.11, but untested.
        
        
        Hacking
        -------
        - The following command will create one virtualenv and sandbox for each latest
          0.12, 1.0 and 1.2 releases of Trac::
        
            $ ./tools/mkenv.sh
        
        - You can then serve one or the other using, the default admin user/pass is
          sandbox/sandbox::
        
            $ ./tools/serve-0.12.sh
            $ ./tools/serve-1.0.sh
            $ ./tools/serve-1.2.sh
        
        - Follow PEP-8, existing style then the following notes.
        - For dictionaries, lists: keep commas after each items, closing bracket
          should close on the same column as the first letter of the statement with the
          opening bracket.
        - Use double-quotes for strings unless it makes it easier on certain strings
          (avoids escaped double-quotes).
        - If an error is exceptional, let the exception rise.
