# A Git Murder Mystery
A murder had been committed in Git Town!

To solve it you'll need to muster all your `git` knowledge (or just google a bunch).

### NOTICE
This repository does not accept pull requests or changes and might be completely and utterly
modified in the future without advance notice. If you'd like to make contributions, feel free to

## Instructions
Clone this repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nivbend/gitstery.git
$ cd gitstery/
```
Then follow the instructions in `instructions.txt`.

The mystery was built so that solving it can be done with `git` commands and `git` commands alone.

## Who is this for?
The target audience are intermediate `git` users, this is not meant to be a tutorial for `git`
newcomers. But feel free to try your hand at this if you'd like! Don't let random `README.md` files
on the internet tell you what you can or cannot do.
