Murder took place {days_since_murder} ago, on {murder_date}. Coroner report says it was some time
between {murder_time_min} and {murder_time_max}.

According to the security guard that sat at the entrance to the factory, on the day of the murder
no one came through the front door. So that leaves the back door, which requires an RFID card to
open.

With the help of the factory's IT department I managed to cherry-pick the relevant commits from the
access log for all the electronically locked facilities on premise. They're on my personal
'{detective_branch}' branch. But they said the program doesn't have a search
button... I'll have to sift through it to find who used "{access_point}". I put the log file in the
evidence folder to look
through later.
