Nobody's home. From the stack of letters in the mailbox nobody's been here for a good few days.

Without a warrant you can't get into the house, but you can still checkout the area. Maybe
talk with some of the neighbors.

The guy next door says he barely ever spoke to the suspect, "was a bit of a loner" is what he
says. Doesn't know what type of vehicle he drives.

You take a stroll around the house, there's a back porch that probably seen better days. You
spot a driveway next to it leading to a garage. The door's open and you see a green Hyundai
parked there.
