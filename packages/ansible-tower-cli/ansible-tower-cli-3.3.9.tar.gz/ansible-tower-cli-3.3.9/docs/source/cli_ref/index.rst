CLI Reference
=============

CLI invocation generally follows this format:

.. code:: bash

    $ tower-cli {resource} {action} ...

The "resource" is a type of object within Tower (a noun), such as
``user``, ``organization``, ``job_template``, etc.; resource names are
always singular in Tower CLI (so it is ``tower-cli user``, never
``tower-cli users``).

The "action" is the thing you want to do (a verb). Most Tower CLI
resources have the following actions--\ ``get``, ``list``, ``create``,
``modify``, and ``delete``--and have options corresponding to fields on
the object in Tower.

Some examples:

.. code:: bash

    # List all users.
    $ tower-cli user list

    # List all non-superusers
    $ tower-cli user list --is-superuser=false

    # Get the user with the ID of 42.
    $ tower-cli user get 42

    # Get the user with the given username.
    $ tower-cli user get --username=guido

    # Create a new user.
    $ tower-cli user create --username=guido --first-name=Guido \
                            --last-name="Van Rossum" --email=guido@python.org \
                            --password=password1234

    # Modify an existing user.
    # This would modify the first name of the user with the ID of "42" to "Guido".
    $ tower-cli user modify 42 --first-name=Guido

    # Modify an existing user, lookup by username.
    # This would use "username" as the lookup, and modify the first name.
    # Which fields are used as lookups vary by resource, but are generally
    # the resource's name.
    $ tower-cli user modify --username=guido --first-name=Guido

    # Delete a user.
    $ tower-cli user delete 42

    # List all jobs
    $ tower-cli job list
    
    # List specific page of job list
    $ tower-cli job list --page=1

    # Launch a job.
    $ tower-cli job launch --job-template=144

    # Monitor a job.
    $ tower-cli job monitor 95
    
    # Filter job list for currently running jobs
    $ tower-cli job list --status=running

    # Export all objects
    $ tower-cli receive --all

    # Export all credentials
    $ tower-cli receive --credential all

    # Export a credential named "My Credential"
    $ tower-cli receive --credential "My Credential"

    # Import from a JSON file named assets.json
    $ tower-cli send assets.json

    # Import anything except an organization defined in a JSON file named assets.json
    $ tower-cli send --prevent organization assets.json

    # Copy all assets from one instance to another
    $ tower-cli receive --tower-host tower1.example.com --all | tower-cli send --tower-host tower2.example.com
    
    # Set OAuth2 Token for Authentication
    $ tower-cli login <username>            
    # you will be prompted for a password, then an OAuth2 token will be created in AWX/Tower and used for future Authentication.



When in doubt, help is available!

.. code:: bash

    $ tower-cli --help # help
    $ tower-cli user --help # resource specific help
    $ tower-cli user create --help # command specific help

.. code:: bash

    $ tower-cli user create --help
    Usage: tower-cli user create [OPTIONS]

      Create a user.

      Fields in the resource's --identity tuple are used for a lookup; if a
      match is found, then no-op (unless --force-on-exists is set) but do not
      fail (unless --fail-on-found is set).

    Field Options:
      --username TEXT              [REQUIRED] The username field.
      --password TEXT              The password field.
      --email TEXT                 [REQUIRED] The email field.
      --first-name TEXT            The first_name field.
      --last-name TEXT             The last_name field.
      --is-superuser BOOLEAN       The is_superuser field.
      --is-system-auditor BOOLEAN  The is_system_auditor field.

    Local Options:
      --fail-on-found    If used, return an error if a matching record already
                         exists.  [default: False]
      --force-on-exists  If used, if a match is found on unique fields, other
                         fields will be updated to the provided values. If False,
                         a match causes the request to be a no-op.  [default:
                         False]

    Global Options:
      --certificate TEXT              Path to a custom certificate file that will
                                      be used throughout the command. Overwritten
                                      by --insecure flag if set.
      --insecure                      Turn off insecure connection warnings. Set
                                      config verify_ssl to make this permanent.
      --description-on                Show description in human-formatted output.
      -v, --verbose                   Show information about requests being made.
      -f, --format [human|json|yaml|id]
                                      Output format. The "human" format is
                                      intended for humans reading output on the
                                      CLI; the "json" and "yaml" formats provide
                                      more data, and "id" echos the object id
                                      only.
      -p, --tower-password TEXT       Password to use to authenticate to Ansible
                                      Tower. This will take precedence over a
                                      password provided to `tower config`, if any.
                                      If set to ASK you will be prompted to
                                      input the password.
      -u, --tower-username TEXT       Username to use to authenticate to Ansible
                                      Tower. This will take precedence over a
                                      username provided to `tower config`, if any.
      -h, --tower-host TEXT           The location of the Ansible Tower host.
                                      HTTPS is assumed as the protocol unless
                                      "http://" is explicitly provided. This will
                                      take precedence over a host provided to
                                      `tower config`, if any.
      --use-token                     Turn on Tower's token-based authentication.
                                      No longer supported in Tower 3.3 and above

    Other Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

There are generally 3 categories of options for each action to take: field options, local options and global
options. Field options can be seen as wrappers around actual resource fields exposed by Tower REST API. They
are generally used to create and modify resources and filter when searching for specific resources; local options
are action-specific options, they provide fine-grained modification of the behavior of a resource action. for
example, ``--fail-on-found`` option of a ``create`` action will fail the command if a matching record already
exists in Tower backend; global options are used to set runtime configuration settings, functioning the same way
as context manager ``tower_cli.conf.Settings.runtime_values`` in :ref:`api-ref-conf`.
