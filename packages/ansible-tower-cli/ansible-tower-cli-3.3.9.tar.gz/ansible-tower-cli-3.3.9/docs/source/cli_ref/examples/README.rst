Example Commands
----------------

Examples here are intended to give concrete examples of how the CLI can
be used in an automated way. It can also help with testing or the
defining of feature requests.

Expect the setup script to take up to 2 minutes to run. Most of this
time is waiting for the project source control to sync the examples from
github to the tower server.

Setup
~~~~~

You should have a version of tower running and configured in the CLI in
order to run any scripts or commands here. With your specific data, that
can done by the following commands:

.. code:: bash

    $ tower-cli config host tower.example.com
    $ tower-cli config username leeroyjenkins
    $ tower-cli config password myPassw0rd

Jobs demonstrated in the script do not connect to another machine, and
do not require valid machine credentials, so tower-cli config
information should be all the unique information necessary.

Create Fake Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to reference the `fake data
creator <https://github.com/ansible/tower-cli/blob/master/docs/source/cli_ref/examples/fake_data_creator.sh>`__
for examples on how to create different types of resources.

If you want to run the script, which auto-populates your Tower server
with a small set of fake data, run the following:

.. code:: bash

    # Populate the server with fake data and run test jobs
    $ cd docs/source/cli_ref/examples/
    $ source fake_data_creator.sh

Cleaning Up
~~~~~~~~~~~

The teardown script removes all of the objects that the CLI can easily
remove. This is not a perfect cleanup, but it performs well enough to
get the system ready to run the fake data creator script again.

.. code:: bash

    # Delete the data that was created (with some exceptions)
    $ source fake_data_teardown.sh

Warnings
~~~~~~~~

It is strongly suggested that you only run these scripts on testing
versions of an Ansible Tower host in order to avoid unintended naming
conflicts.

Python Module Use Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This bash script example borrows fake data elements from the `tower
populator script <https://github.com/jsmartin/tower_populator>`__. The
tower\_populator script provides an example of how to use the tower-cli
python modules.
