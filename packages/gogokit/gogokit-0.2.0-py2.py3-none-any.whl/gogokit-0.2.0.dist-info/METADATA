Description: # The GogoKit Python Toolkit
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/viagogo/gogokit.py.svg?branch=master)][travis]
        
        [travis]: https://travis-ci.org/viagogo/gogokit.py
        [apidocs]: http://developer.viagogo.net

        [apidocsgettingstarted]: http://developer.viagogo.net/#getting-started
        
        Python toolkit for working with the viagogo API. Our [developer site][apidocs]
        documents all of the viagogo APIs.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install via pip
        
            pip install --upgrade gogokit
        
        ... or
        
            easy_install --upgrade gogokit
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        See our [developer site][apidocsgettingstarted] for more examples.
        
        python
        from gogokit import ViagogoClient
        
        # All methods require OAuth2 authentication. To get OAuth2 credentials for your
        # application, see http://developer.viagogo.net/#authentication.
        client = ViagogoClient(YOUR_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET)
        
        
        # Get an access token. See http://developer.viagogo.net/#getting-access-tokens
        token = client.oauth.get_client_access_token()
        client.set_token(token)
        
        
        # Get a list of events, categories, venues and metro areas that match the given
        # search query
        search = client.search.get_search_results({ "query": "Real Madrid" })
        
        # Get the different event genres (see http://developer.viagogo.net/#entities)
        genres = client.category.get_genres()

        file and make some changes. Once you're done with your changes send a pull
        request. Thanks!
        
        
        ## Need Help? Found a bug?
        
        Just [submit a issue][submitanissue] if you need any help. And, of course, feel
        free to submit pull requests with bug fixes or changes.
        
        
        ## Supported Python Versions
        
        This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Python
        implementations:
        
        * Python 2.6
        * Python 2.7
        * Python 3.3
        * Python 3.4
        
        If something doesn't work on one of these python versions, it's a bug.
        
        This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Python
        implementations, but support will only be provided for the versions listed
        above.
        
        If you would like this library to support another Python version, you may
        volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
        run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
        implementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely
        fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time
        of a major release, support for that Python version may be dropped.
