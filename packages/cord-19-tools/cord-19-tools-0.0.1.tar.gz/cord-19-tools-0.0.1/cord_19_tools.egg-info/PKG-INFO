Description: # COVID-19 Data Tools
        
        Tools for making COVID 19 data slightly easier for everyone!
        
        ## The Paperset class
        
        This is a class for lazily loading papers from the [CORD-19 dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research). Here are the instructions for use:
        
        1. Download a dataset in tar.gz form from the **Download Here** section, or using [download bash script](data/download.sh) in this repository (which automatically completes step 2 for you)
        
        2. Extract it into a directory of your choice (functionality for leaving the tarballs unpacked/online may be added later, this is version 0.0.1), for example:
        
        ```sh
        tar -xvzf comm_use_subset.tar.gz 
        ```
        
        3. Load it into python!
        
        ```python
        import cotools
        from pprint import pprint
        
        # no `/` at the end please!
        data = cotools.Paperset("data/comm_use_subset")
        
        # indexes with ints
        pprint(data[0])
        
        # and slices!
        pprint(data[:2])
        ```
        
        Lets talk for a bit about how it works, and why it doesnt take a gigantic amount of memory. The files are not actually loaded into python ***until the data is indexed***. Upon indexing, the files at those indexes are read into python, resulting in a list of dictionaries.
