Description: # StreamFlow
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/alpha-unito/streamflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/alpha-unito/streamflow)
        
        The StreamFlow framework is a container-native *Workflow Management System (WMS)* written in Python 3.
        It has been designed around two main principles:
        * Allow the execution of tasks in **multi-container environments**, in order to support concurrent execution
        of multiple communicating tasks in a multi-agent ecosystem.
        * Relax the requirement of a single shared data space, in order to allow for **hybrid workflow** executions on top of
        multi-cloud or hybrid cloud/HPC infrastructures.
        
        ## Use StreamFlow
        
        The StreamFlow module is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/streamflow/), so you can install it using pip.
        
        ```bash
        pip install streamflow
        ```
        
        Please note that StreamFlow requires `python >= 3.7`. Then you can execute it directly from the CLI
        
        ```bash
        streamflow /path/to/streamflow.yml
        ```
        
        ## Contribute to StreamFlow
        
        StreamFlow uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/) to guarantee deterministic builds.
        Therefore, the recommended way to manage dependencies is by means of the `pipenv` command.
        
        As a first step, get StreamFlow from [GitHub](https://github.com/alpha-unito/streamflow) 
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:alpha-unito/streamflow.git
        ```
        
        Then you can install all the requred packages using the `pipenv` command
        ```bash
        pip install --user pipenv
        cd streamflow
        pipenv install
        ```
        
        Finally, you can run StreamFlow in the generated virtual environment
        ```bash
        pipenv run python -m streamflow
        ```
        
        StreamFlow relies on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) for PyPI distribution. Therefore, in order to publish a
        new version of the package on PyPI, you only have to augment the version number in `setup.py` file.
