        "\n",
        "### Model Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "In the dataset of Boston house price, there are 14 values associated with the home: the first 13 are used to describe various information of house, that is $x_i$ in the model; the last value is the medium price of the house we want to predict, which is $y_i$ in the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, our model can be expressed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\hat{Y} = \\omega_1X_{1} + \\omega_2X_{2} + \\ldots + \\omega_{13}X_{13} + b$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\hat{Y}$ represents the predicted result of the model and is used to distinguish it from the real value $Y$. The parameters to be learned by the model are: $\\omega_1, \\ldots, \\omega_{13}, b$.\n",
        "\n",
        "After building the model, we need to give the model an optimization goal so that the learned parameters can make the predicted value $\\hat{Y}$ get as close to the true value $Y$. Here we introduce the concept of loss function ([Loss Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function), or Cost Function.  Input the target value $y_{i}$ of any data sample and the predicted value $\\hat{y_{i}}$ given by a model. Then the loss function outputs a non-negative real number, which is usually used to represent model error.\n",
        "\n",
        "For linear regression models, the most common loss function is the Mean Squared Error ([MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error)), which is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$MSE=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(\\hat{Y_i}-Y_i)}^2$$\n",
        "\n",
        "That is, for a test set in size of $n$, $MSE$ is the mean of the squared error of the $n$ data prediction results.\n",
        "\n",
        "The method used to optimize the loss function is generally the gradient descent method. The gradient descent method is a first-order optimization algorithm. If $f(x)$ is defined and divisible at point $x_n$, then $f(x)$ is considered to be the fastest in the negative direction of the gradient $-▽f(x_n)$ at point of $x_n$. Adjust $x$ repeatedly to make $f(x)$ close to the local or global minimum value. The adjustment is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$x_n+1=x_n-λ▽f(x), n≧0$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where λ represents the learning rate. This method of adjustment is called the gradient descent method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Training Process\n",
        "\n",
        "After defining the model structure, we will train the model through the following steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Initialize parameters, including weights $\\omega_i$ and bias $b$, to initialize them (eg. 0 as mean, 1 as variance).\n",
        "  2. Forward propagation of network calculates network output and loss functions.\n",
        "  3. Reverse error propagation according to the loss function ( [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) ), passing forward the network error from the output layer and updating the parameters in the network.\n",
        "  4. Repeat steps 2~3 until the network training error reaches the specified level or the training round reaches the set value.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Data Pre-processing\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Continuous value and discrete value\n",
        "Analyzing the data, first we find that all 13-dimensional attributes exist 12-dimensional continuous value and 1-dimensional discrete values (CHAS). Discrete value is often represented by numbers like 0, 1, and 2, but its meaning is different from continuous value's because the difference of discrete value here has no meaning. For example, if we use 0, 1, and 2 to represent red, green, and blue, we cannot infer that the distance between blue and red is longer than that between green and red. So usually for a discrete property with $d$ possible values, we will convert them to $d$ binary properties with a value of 0 or 1 or map each possible value to a multidimensional vector. However, there is no this problem for CHAS, since CHAS itself is a binary attribute .\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Normalization of attributes\n",
        "Another fact that can be easily found is that the range of values of each dimensional attribute is largely different (as shown in Figure 2). For example, the value range of attribute B is [0.32, 396.90], and the value range of attribute NOX is [0.3850, 0.8170]. Here is a common operation - normalization. The goal of normalization is to scale the value of each attribute to a similar range, such as [-0.5, 0.5]. Here we use a very common operation method: subtract the mean and divide by the range of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are at least three reasons for implementing normalization (or [Feature scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling)):\n",
        "\n",
        "- A range of values that are too large or too small can cause floating value overflow or underflow during calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Different ranges of number result in different attributes being different for the model (at least in the initial period of training), and this implicit assumption is often unreasonable. This can make the optimization process difficult and the training time greatly longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Many machine learning techniques/models (such as L1, L2 regular items, Vector Space Model) are based on the assumption that all attribute values are almost zero and their ranges of value are similar.\n",

        "We split the dataset into two parts: one is used to adjust the parameters of the model, that is, to train the model, the error of the model on this dataset is called ** training error **; the other is used to test.The error of the model on this dataset is called the ** test error**. The goal of our training model is to predict unknown new data by finding the regulation from the training data, so the test error is an better indicator for the performance of the model. When it comes to the ratio of the segmentation data, we should take into account two factors: more training data will reduce the square error of estimated parameters, resulting in a more reliable model; and more test data will reduce the square error of the test error, resulting in more credible test error. The split ratio set in our example is $8:2$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In a more complex model training process, we often need more than one dataset: the validation set. Because complex models often have some hyperparameters ([Hyperparameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization)) that need to be adjusted, we will try a combination of multiple hyperparameters to train multiple models separately and then compare their performance on the validation set to select the relatively best set of hyperparameters, and finally use the model with this set of parameters to evaluate the test error on the test set. Since the model trained in this chapter is relatively simple, we won't talk about this process at present.\n",
