        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared with words, images provide information in a much more vivid, artistic, easy-to-understand manner. They are an important source for people to express and exchange ideas. In this chapter, we focus on one of the essential problems in image recognition -- image classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Image classification is the task of distinguishing images in different categories based on their semantic meaning. It is a core problem in computer vision and is also the foundation of other higher level computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, object tracking, action recognition. Image classification has applications in many areas such as face recognition, intelligent video analysis in security systems, traffic scene recognition in transportation systems, content-based image retrieval and automatic photo indexing in Internet services, image classification in medicine industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "To classify an image we firstly encode the entire image using manual or learned features and then determine the category using a classifier. Thus, feature extraction plays an important role in image classification. Prior to deep learning the BoW(Bag of Words) model was the most widely used method for classifying an image. The BoW technique was introduced in Natural Language Processing where a training sentence is represented as a bag of words. In the context of image classification, the BoW model requires constructing a dictionary. The simplest BoW framework can be designed in three steps: **feature extraction**, **feature encoding** and **classifier design**.\n",
        "\n",
        "With Deep learning, image classification can be framed as a supervised or unsupervised learning problem that uses hierarchical features automatically without any need for manually crafted features from the image. In recent years, Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have made significant progress in image classification. CNNs use raw image pixels as input, extract low-level and high-level abstract features through convolution operations, and directly output the classification results from the model. This style of end-to-end learning has led to not only higher performance but also wider adoption in various applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we introduce deep-learning-based image classification methods and explain how to train a CNN model using PaddlePaddle.\n",

        "## Exploration of Models\n",
        "\n",
        "A large amount of researches in image classification are built upon benchmark datasets such as [PASCAL VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) etc. Many image classification algorithms are usually evaluated and compared based on these datasets. PASCAL VOC is a computer vision competition started in 2005, and ImageNet is a dataset holding Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) started in 2010. In this chapter, we introduce some image classification models from the submissions to these competitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Before 2012, traditional image classification was accomplished with the three steps described in the background section. A complete model construction usually involves the following stages: low-level feature extraction, feature encoding, spatial constraint or feature clustering, classifier design, model ensemble.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1). **Low-level feature extraction**: This step extracts large amounts of local features according to fixed strides and scales. Popular local features include Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) \\[[1](#References)\\], Histogram of Oriented Gradient(HOG) \\[[2](#References)\\], Local Binary Pattern(LBP) \\[[3](#References)\\], etc. A common practice is to employ multiple feature descriptors in order to avoid missing a lot of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2). **Feature encoding**: Low-level features contain a large amount of redundancy and noise. In order to improve the robustness of features, it is necessary to employ a feature transformation to encode low-level features. This is called feature encoding. Common feature encoding methods include vector quantization  \\[[4](#References)\\], sparse coding  \\[[5](#References)\\], locality-constrained linear coding  \\[[6](#References)\\], Fisher vector encoding  \\[[7](#References)\\], etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3). **Spatial constraint**: Spatial constraint or feature clustering is usually adopted after feature encoding for extracting the maximum or average of each dimension in the spatial domain. Pyramid feature matching--a popular feature clustering method--divides an image uniformly into patches and performs feature clustering in each patch.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4). **Classification**: In the above steps an image can be described by a vector of fixed dimension. Then a classifier can be used to classify the image into categories. Common classifiers include Support Vector Machine(SVM), random forest etc. Kernel SVM is the most popular classifier and has achieved very good performance in traditional image classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This classic method has been used widely as image classification algorithm in PASCAL VOC  \\[[18](#References)\\]. [NEC Labs](http://www.nec-labs.com/) won the championship by employing SIFT and LBP features, two non-linear encoders and SVM in ILSVRC 2010  \\[[8](#References)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "The CNN model--AlexNet proposed by Alex Krizhevsky et al. \\[[9](#References)\\], made a breakthrough in ILSVRC 2012. It dramatically outperformed classical methods and won the ILSVRC championship in 2012. This was also the first time that a deep learning method was adopted for large-scale image classification. Since AlexNet, a series of CNN models have been proposed that have advanced the state of the art steadily on Imagenet as shown in Figure 4. With deeper and more sophisticated architectures, Top-5 error rate is getting lower and lower (to around 3.5%). The error rate of human raters on the same Imagenet dataset is 5.1%, which means that the image classification capability of a deep learning model has surpassed human raters.\n",

        "\n",
        "- pooling layer: this layer down-samples feature maps by extracting local max (max-pooling) or average (avg-pooling) value of each patch in the feature map. Down-sampling is a common operation in image processing and is used to filter out trivial high-frequency information.\n",

        "- fully-connected layer: this layer fully connects neurons between two adjacent layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- non-linear activation: Convolutional and fully-connected layers are usually followed by some non-linear activation layers. Non-linearities enhance the expression capability of the network. Some examples of non-linear activation functions are Sigmoid, Tanh and ReLU. ReLU is the most commonly used activation function in CNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dropout \\[[10](#References)\\]: At each training stage, individual nodes are dropped out of the network with a certain random probability. This improves the network's ability to generalize and avoids overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameter updates at each layer during training causes input layer distributions to change and in turn requires hyper-parameters to be carefully tuned. In 2015, Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy proposed a Batch Normalization (BN) algorithm \\[[14](#References)\\], which normalizes the features of each batch in a layer, and enables relatively stable distribution in each layer. Not only does BN algorithm act as a regularizer, but also eliminates the need for meticulous hyper-parameter design. Experiments demonstrate that BN algorithm accelerates the training convergence and has been widely used in further deeper models.\n",

        "The Oxford Visual Geometry Group (VGG) proposed the VGG network in ILSVRC 2014 \\[[11](#References)\\]. This model is deeper and wider than previous neural architectures. Its major part is the five main groups of convolution operations. Adjacent convolution groups are connected via max-pooling layers to perform dimensionality reduction. Each group contains a series of 3x3 convolutional layers (i.e. kernels). The number of convolution kernels stays the same within the single group and increases from 64 in the first group to 512 in the last one. Double FC layers and a classifier layer will follow afterwards. The total number of learnable layers could be 11, 13, 16, or 19 depending on the number of convolutional layers in each group. Figure 6 illustrates a 16-layer VGG. The architecture of VGG is relatively simple and has been adopted by many papers such as the first one that surpassed human-level performance on ImageNet \\[[19](#References)\\].\n",

        "GoogLeNet \\[[12](#References)\\] won the ILSVRC championship in 2014. GoogLeNet borrowed some ideas from the Network in Network(NIN) model \\[[13](#References)\\] and is built on the Inception blocks. Let us first familiarize ourselves with these concepts first.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two main characteristics of the NIN model are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) A single-layer convolutional network is replaced with a Multi-Layer Perceptron Convolution (MLPconv). MLPconv is a tiny multi-layer convolutional network. It enhances non-linearity by adding several 1x1 convolutional layers after linear ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) In traditional CNNs, the last fewer layers are usually fully-connected with a large number of parameters. In contrast, the last convolution layer of NIN contains feature maps of the same size as the category dimension, and  NIN replaces fully-connected layers with global average pooling to fetch a vector of the same size as category dimension and classify them. This replacement of fully-connected layers significantly reduces the number of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 7 depicts two Inception blocks. Figure 7(a) is the simplest design. The output is a concatenation of features from three convolutional layers and one pooling layer. The disadvantage of this design is that the pooling layer does not change the number of channels and leads to an increased channel number of features after concatenation. After several such blocks, the number of channels and parameters become larger and larger and lead to higher computation complexity. To overcome this drawback, the Inception block in Figure 7(b) employs three 1x1 convolutional layers to perform dimensionality reduction, which, to put it simply, is to reduce the number of channels and simultaneously improve the non-linearity of the network.\n",

The difference between GoogLeNet and NIN is that GoogLeNet adds a fully connected layer after avg-pooling layer to output a vector of category size. Besides these two characteristics, the features from middle layers of a GoogLeNet are also very discriminative. Therefore, GoogeleNet inserts two auxiliary classifiers in the model for enhancing gradient and regularization when doing back-propagation. The loss function of the whole network is the weighted sum of these three classifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Figure 8 illustrates the neural architecture of a GoogLeNet which consists of 22 layers: it starts with three regular convolutional layers followed by three groups of sub-networks -- the first group contains two Inception blocks, the second group has five, and the third group has two again. Finally, It ends with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer.\n",

        "Residual Network(ResNet) \\[[15](#References)\\] won the 2015 championship on three ImageNet competitions -- image classification, object localization, and object detection. The main challenge in training deeper networks is that accuracy degrades with network depth. The authors of ResNet proposed a residual learning approach to ease the training of deeper networks. Based on the design ideas of BN, small convolutional kernels, full convolutional network, ResNets reformulate the layers as residual blocks, with each block containing two branches, one directly connecting input to the output, the other performing two to three convolutions and calculating the residual function with reference to the layer's inputs. The output features of these two branches are then added up.\n",

        "Figure 9 illustrates the ResNet architecture. To the left is the basic building block, it consists of two 3x3 convolutional layers with the same size of output channels. To the right is a Bottleneck block. The bottleneck is a 1x1 convolutional layer used to reduce dimension (from 256 to 64 here). The following 1x1 convolutional layer is used to increase dimension from 64 to 256. Thus, the number of input and output channels of the middle 3x3 convolutional layer is relatively small (64-\u003e64 in this example).\n",

        "The traditional image classification method consists of multiple stages. The framework is a little complex. In contrast, the end-to-end CNN model can be implemented in one step, and the accuracy of classification is greatly improved. In this article, we first introduced three classic models, VGG, GoogLeNet and ResNet. Then we have introduced how to use PaddlePaddle to configure and train CNN models based on CIFAR10 dataset, especially VGG and ResNet models. Finally, we have guided you how to use PaddlePaddle's API interfaces to predict images and extract features. For other datasets such as ImageNet, the configuration and training process is the same, so you can embark on your adventure on your own.\n",
