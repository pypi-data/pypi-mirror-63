        "\n",
        "In natural language processing, sentiment analysis generally refers to judging the emotion expressed by a piece of text. Among them, a piece of text can be a sentence, a paragraph or a document. Emotional state can be two categories, such as (positive, negative), (happy, sad); or three categories, such as (positive, negative, neutral) and so on.The application scenarios of understanding sentiment are very broad, such as dividing the comments posted by users on shopping websites (Amazon, Tmall, Taobao, etc.), travel websites, and movie review websites into positive comments and negative comments; or in order to analyze the user's overall experience with a product, grab user reviews of the product, and perform sentiment analysis. Table 1 shows an example of understanding sentiment of movie reviews:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Movie Comments | Category |\n",
        "| -------- | ----- |\n",
        "|In Feng Xiaogang’s movies of the past few years, it is the best one | Positive |\n",
        "|Very bad feat, like a local TV series | Negative |\n",
        "|The round-lens lens is full of brilliance, and the tonal background is beautiful, but the plot is procrastinating, the accent is not good, and even though taking an effort but it is hard to focus on the show | Negative |\n",
        "|The plot could be scored 4 stars. In addition, the angle of the round lens plusing the scenery of Wuyuan is very much like the feeling of Chinese landscape painting. It satisfied me. | Positive |\n",
        "\n",
        "\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003eForm 1  Sentiment analysis of movie comments\u003c/p\u003e\n",
        "\n",
        "In natural language processing, sentiment is a typical problem of **text categorization**, which divides the text that needs to be sentiment analysis into its category. Text categorization involves two issues: text representation and classification methods. Before the emergence of the deep learning, the mainstream text representation methods are BOW (bag of words), topic models, etc.; the classification methods are SVM (support vector machine), LR (logistic regression) and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a piece of text, BOW means that its word order, grammar and syntax are ignored, and this text is only treated as a collection of words, so the BOW method does not adequately represent the semantic information of the text. For example, the sentence \"This movie is awful\" and \"a boring, empty, non-connotative work\" have a high semantic similarity in sentiment analysis, but their BOW representation has a similarity of zero. Another example is that the BOW is very similar to the sentence \"an empty, work without connotations\" and \"a work that is not empty and has connotations\", but in fact they mean differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "The deep learning we are going to introduce in this chapter overcomes the above shortcomings of BOW representation. It maps text to low-dimensional semantic space based on word order, and performs text representation and classification in end-to-end mode. Its performance is significantly improved compared to the traditional method \\[[1](#References)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model Overview\n",
        "The text representation models used in this chapter are Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks and their extensions. These models are described below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction of Text Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
        "\n",
        "We introduced the calculation process of the CNN model applied to text data in the [Recommended System](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/05.recommender_system) section. Here is a simple review.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a CNN, first convolute input word vector sequence to generate a feature map, and then obtain the features of the whole sentence corresponding to the kernel by using a max pooling over time on the feature map. Finally, the splicing of all the features obtained is the fixed-length vector representation of the text. For the text classification problem, connecting it via softmax to construct a complete model. In actual applications, we use multiple convolution kernels to process sentences, and convolution kernels with the same window size are stacked to form a matrix, which can complete the operation more efficiently. In addition, we can also use the convolution kernel with different window sizes to process the sentence. Figure 3 in the [Recommend System](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/05.recommender_system) section shows four convolution kernels, namely Figure 1 below, with different colors representing convolution kernel operations of different sizes.\n",

If you want a more abstract and advanced text feature representation, you can construct a deep text convolutional neural network\\[[2](#References), [3](#References)\\].\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n",
        "\n",
        "RNN is a powerful tool for accurately modeling sequence data. In fact, the theoretical computational power of the RNN is perfected by Turing' \\[[4](#References)\\]. Natural language is a typical sequence data (word sequence). In recent years, RNN and its derivation (such as long short term memory\\[[5](#References)\\]) have been applied in many natural language fields, such as in language models, syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling (or general sequence labeling), semantic representation, graphic generation, dialogue, machine translation, etc., all perform well and even become the best at present.\n",

        "Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the RNN expanded by time\n",
        "\u003c/p\u003e\n",
        "\n",
        "The RNN expands as time is shown in Figure 2: at the time of $t$, the network reads the $t$th input $x_t$ (vector representation) and the state value of the hidden layer at the previous moment $h_{t- 1}$ (vector representation, $h_0$ is normally initialized to $0$ vector), and calculate the state value $h_t$ of the hidden layer at this moment. Repeat this step until all the inputs have been read. If the function is recorded as $f$, its formula can be expressed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$h_t=f(x_t,h_{t-1})=\\sigma(W_{xh}x_t+W_{hh}h_{t-1}+b_h)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $W_{xh}$ is the matrix parameter of the input to the hidden layer, $W_{hh}$ is the matrix parameter of the hidden layer to the hidden layer, and $b_h$ is the bias vector parameter of the hidden layer, $\\sigma $ is the $sigmoid$ function.\n",
        "\n",
        "When dealing with natural language, the word (one-hot representation) is usually mapped to its word vector representation, and then used as the input $x_t$ for each moment of the recurrent neural network. In addition, other layers may be connected to the hidden layer of the RNN depending on actual needs. For example, you can connect the hidden layer output of a RNN to the input of the next RNN to build a deep or stacked RNN, or extract the hidden layer state at the last moment as a sentence representation and then implement a classification model, etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "For longer sequence data, the gradient disappearance or explosion phenomenon is likely to occur during training RNN\\[[6](#References)\\]. To solve this problem, Hochreiter S, Schmidhuber J. (1997) proposed LSTM (long short term memory\\[[5](#References)\\]).\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to a simple RNN, LSTM adds memory unit $c$, input gate $i$, forget gate $f$, and output gate $o$. The combination of these gates and memory units greatly enhances the ability of the recurrent neural network to process long sequence data. If the function \\is denoted as $F$, the formula is:\n",

The input gate controls the intensity of the new input into the memory unit $c$, the forget gate controls the intensity of the memory unit to maintain the previous time value, and the output gate controls the intensity of the output memory unit. The three gates are calculated in a similar way, but with completely different parameters.They controll the memory unit $c$ in different ways, as shown in Figure 3:\n",

Similarly, in order to get the following context information, we can use a RNN in the opposite direction (which will be processed in reverse order). Combined with the method of constructing deep-loop neural networks (deep neural networks often get more abstract and advanced feature representations), we can build a more powerful LSTM-based stack bidirectional recurrent neural network\\[[9](#References )\\] to model time series data.\n",
        "\n",
        "As shown in Figure 4 (taking three layers as an example), the odd-numbered LSTM is forward and the even-numbered LSTM is inverted. The higher-level LSTM uses the lower LSTM and all previous layers of information as input. The maximum pooling of the highest-level LSTM sequence in the time dimension can be used to obtain a fixed-length vector representation of the text (this representation fully fuses the contextual information and deeply abstracts of the text), and finally we connect the text representation to the softmax to build the classification model.\n",
