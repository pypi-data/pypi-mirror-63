Description: # nf-batch-runner
        
        nf-batch-runner is a tool which makes it easier to run Nextflow pipelines in your AWS account.
        
        *This tool is not endorsed by Nextflow or AWS*
        
        Using AWS Batch, you can run pipelines in the cloud which scale up and down quickly so that 
        you don't pay for servers to sit idle.
        
        ## How it works
        
        nf-batch-runner pulls down an AWS CloudFormation template and deploys it into your AWS account.  This
        creates resources which are needed to run a Nextflow pipeline in AWS.
        
        It also creates an optional web frontend so that you can starts pipelines from your web browser.
        
        You can [find out more](https://gitlab.com/cgps/nf-batch-runner) in our README.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Create an AWS account and create credentials for an Admin user.  It may be posssible to run this tool
        with lower priviledges but it needs to create IAM resources so it won't help a lot.
        
        Setup your default credentials as if you were going to [use the AWS cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
        
        This tool has been tested running from OSX and Windows machines with Python 3.  Linux is probably also fine.
        
        ```
        $ pip install nf-batch-runner
        $ nf-batch-runner create my-environment
        Please give us a password you will use to login to the frontend
