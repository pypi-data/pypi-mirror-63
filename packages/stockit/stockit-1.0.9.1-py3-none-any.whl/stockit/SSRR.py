class SSRR:
    '''serialized slope randomized regression implementation developed by Ben Caunt.

    The SSRR algorithm works as such, for each given data point, calculate the slope between each point then average them together

    Set b equal to the last data point in the set.
    When making a prdiction,  for each index after the final index in the dataset,
    add a random bias (+ or - the Mean Absolute Deviation) to each indicie up to the final predicted indicie and include the slopes between these predicted prices as part of the slope average calculated with the data
    use y = mx + b to calculate result
