FLORIS Wake Modeling Utility

Background and Objectives
=========================
This FLORIS framework is designed to provide a computationally inexpensive,
controls-oriented modeling tool of the steady-state wake characteristics in
a wind farm. The wake models implemented in this version of FLORIS are:

- Jensen model for velocity deficit
- Jimenez model for wake deflection
- Gauss model for wake deflection and velocity deficit
- Multi zone model for wake deflection and velocity deficit
- Curl  model for wake deflection and velocity deficit

More information on all of these models can be found in the
`theory <https://floris.readthedocs.io/en/develop/source/theory.html>`_
section of the online documentation.

modeling and simulation tool for controls research are

.. _installation:

Installation
============
Using ``pip``, FLORIS can be installed in two ways

- local editable install

- using a tagged release version from the ``pip`` repo

For consistency between all developers, it is recommended to use Python
virtual environments;
`this link <https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>`_
provides a great introduction. Using virtual environments in a Jupyter Notebook
is described `here <https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/IPythonNotebookVirtualenvs/>`_.

Local Editable Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The local editable installation allows developers to maintain an importable
instance of FLORIS while continuing to extend it. The alternative is to
constantly update python paths within the package to match the local
environment.

Before doing the local install, the source code repository must be cloned
directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/nrel/floris

Then, using the local editable installation is as simple as running the
following command from the parent directory of the
cloned repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e floris

Finally, test the installation by starting a python terminal and importing
FLORIS:

.. code-block:: bash

    import floris

pip Repo Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The FLORIS version available through the pip repository is typically the latest
tagged and released major version. This version represents the most recent
stable, tested, and validated code.

In this case, there is no need to download the source code directly. FLORIS
and its dependencies can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install floris

Dependencies
============
FLORIS has dependencies on various math, statistics, and plotting libraries in
addition to other general purpose packages. For the simulation and tool
modules, the dependencies are listed in ``floris/requirements.txt``. The
documentation has additional requirements listed in
``floris/docs/requirements.txt``.

The requirements files can be used to install everything with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
