Description: eFitness.com.pl booking sniper
        ==============================
        
        This small utility books trainings on eFitness.com.pl in your name. Be always first on list for your favourite training. Code basically allows my wife to always attend her favourite trainings :)
        
        Installation
        ============
        ```
        pip install efitness-sniper
        ```
        
        Usage
        =====
        Create file `.efitness.yml` in your home directory with:
        
        ```
        ---
        login_data:
          subdomain: modelarnia-bb-cms # this is a subdomain of club (example for http://modelarnia-bb-cms.efitness.com.pl)
          user: your_login_name # specify your account login
          password: your_password # specify account password
        
        sniper_rules: # You can define as much rules as you want :)
        # How much days script should look forward (if bigger - it traverses more calendar pages, so I recommend to set it n+1 day
        # where n is maximum time before allowed registration) - minimum here is 3 (due to cancellation policy)
        # lower values will be overriden to 3
          - look_ahead_days: 6 
            match: "BODY BALL" # Name of training - you can use part of name, eg. BALL will match BODY BALL
            day_of_week: 0 # Specify day of week that you are interrested in (0 - Monday)
            after_hour: 16:00 # Do not book trainings before 4PM
            before_hour: 21:00 # Do not book trainings after 9PM
          - look_ahead_days: 6 # Another training definition
            match: "TRX"
            day_of_week: 2
            after_hour: 18:00
            before_hour: 21:00
        ```
        
        Add `efitness` command to your crontab - I recommend to not do it more often than 15min, so: `*/15 * * * *`
