Description: # GraPhysio
        GraPhysio is a graphical data visualizer for physiologic data signals
        from ICU patient monitors.
        
        ## Install instructions
        To make GraPhysio work you need Python version >=3.4 as well as PyQt.
        GraPhysio makes heavy use of scientific Python libraries like Pandas,
        NumPy and SciPy. Plotting relies on the excellent PyQtGraph library.
        You may want to install one of the scientific Python packages like
        [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) if you don't want to
        manually handle the dependencies. Make sure to grab the Python 3
        version.
        
        You can then install the latest version of GraPhysio by tying the
        following command:
        
        > pip install graphysio
        
        You can launch GraPhysio by typing:
        
        > graphysioui.py
