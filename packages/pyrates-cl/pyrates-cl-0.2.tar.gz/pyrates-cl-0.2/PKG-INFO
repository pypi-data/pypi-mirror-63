Description: PyRates
        =============
        PyRates supports conversion between 54 currency rates
        -------
        Can be used as:
        - Package/Module
        - CLI
        - GUI
        
        The rates are fetched by webscraping x-rates.com and saved locally
        
        In order to keep get-requests to a minimum, rates are only updated if they are older than 30 minutes
        
        The base currency is by default: Euro. Work in progress to let the user change the base currency at will
