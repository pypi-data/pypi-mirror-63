Option Calculator and Simulator

An option calculator born from the need to calculate the prices of various options in the QCF program at Georgia Tech. This package provides:

* Black Scholes pricing of traditional, barrier and exotic options
* Greeks of European style options
* Simulations of underlying asset using stochastic processes
* Pricing of options utilizing the simulated motion of the underlying

This was made initially to help avoid rewriting a Black Scholes calculators each time it was necessary. I'm hoping it can also provide an outlet for those looking for a general code/framework to help in the creation and experimentation of their own option simulations. Each function and class has a complete explanation on what it does, should the user be interested. For example, if you want to know how to work the European option function, simply type :

    >>> from qcfoptions import bsoptions
    >>> help(bsoptions.EuroOptions)

into the command console, and it should return a relatively complete description of the function.

You can install this package from PyPI by using the command :

    pip install qcfoptions
