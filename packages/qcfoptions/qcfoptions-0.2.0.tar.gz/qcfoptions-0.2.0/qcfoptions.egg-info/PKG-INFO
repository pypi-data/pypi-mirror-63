        An option calculator born from the need to calculate the prices of various options in the QCF program at Georgia Tech. This package provides:
        
        * Black Scholes pricing of traditional, barrier and exotic options
        * Greeks of European style options
        * Simulations of underlying asset using stochastic processes
        * Pricing of options utilizing the simulated motion of the underlying
        
        This was made initially to help avoid rewriting a Black Scholes calculators each time it was necessary. I'm hoping it can also provide an outlet for those looking for a general code/framework to help in the creation and experimentation of their own option simulations. Each function and class has a complete explanation on what it does, should the user be interested. For example, if you want to know how to work the European option function, simply type :
        
            >>> from qcfoptions import bsoptions
            >>> help(bsoptions.EuroOptions)
        
        into the command console, and it should return a relatively complete description of the function.
        
        You can install this package from PyPI by using the command :
        
            pip install qcfoptions
