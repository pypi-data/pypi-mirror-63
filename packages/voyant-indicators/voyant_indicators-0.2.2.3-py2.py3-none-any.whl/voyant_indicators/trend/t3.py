def t3(df, price, n, col="t3", v_factor=0.7):
    """
    The T3 is a type of moving average, or smoothing function. It is based on the
    DEMA. The T3 takes the DEMA calculation and adds a vfactor which is between
    zero and 1. The resultant function is called the GD, or Generalized DEMA. A
    GD with vfactorof 1 is the same as the DEMA. A GD with a vfactor of zero is
    the same as an Exponential Moving Average. The T3 typically uses a vfactor
    of 0.7.

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame which contain the asset price.
        price (string): the column name of the price of the asset.
        t3 (string): the column name for the t3 moving average results.
        n (int): the total number of periods.
        v_factor (float): v factor is a volume factor between 0 and 1 which
                          determines how the moving averages responds.

    Returns:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Dataframe with t3 moving average of the asset calculated.
