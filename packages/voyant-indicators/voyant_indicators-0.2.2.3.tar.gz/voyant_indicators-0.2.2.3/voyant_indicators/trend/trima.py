def trima(df, price,n, col="trima"):
    """
    The Triangular Moving Average (TRIMA) is similar to other moving averages in
    that it shows the average (or mean) price over a specified number of data
    points (usually a number of price bars). However, the triangular moving average
    differs in that it is double smoothedâ€”which also means averaged twice.

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame which contain the asset price.
        price (string): the column name of the price of the asset.
        trima (string): the column name for the n-day double exponential moving average results.
        n (int): the total number of periods.

    Returns:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Dataframe with triangular moving average of the asset calculated.
