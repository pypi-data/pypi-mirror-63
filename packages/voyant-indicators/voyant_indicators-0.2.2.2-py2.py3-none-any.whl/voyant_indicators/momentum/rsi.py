    """
    The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the
    magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold
    conditions in the price of a stock or other asset.

    First calculations for average gain and average loss are simple n-period averages,
        1st average gain = sum of gains over the n periods / n
        1st average loss = sum of losses over the n periods / n

    Subsequent calculations are based on prior averages and the current gains / losses,
        average gain = (previous gain * (n - 1) + current gain) / n
        average loss = (previous loss * (n - 1) + current loss) / n

    RSI = 100 * (average gain / (average gain + average loss))

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame which contain the asset price.
        price (string): the column name of the price of the asset.
        col (string): the column name for the rsi values.
        n (int): the total number of periods.

    Returns:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Dataframe with rsi of the asset calculated.
