# NVStatsRecorder

Simple Python utilities to instrument NVIDIA GPUs, designed to work directly from within Jupyter Notebooks requiring minimal system utilities.

This allows users to quickly judge if their code takes proper advantage of NVIDIA GPUs and diagnose performance bottlenecks.

**Features**

* Works entirely from within Python
* Record NVIDIA GPU metrics without additional system utilities
* Helper functions to plot graphs visualising GPU usage
* NVLink bandwidth measurements (**require elevated permissions**)
* Returns raw data, including system-provided reasons for performance throttling
* Works from within Docker (when used with compatible GPU runtime)

## Usage

### Installing

```shell
pip install nvstatsrecorder
```
