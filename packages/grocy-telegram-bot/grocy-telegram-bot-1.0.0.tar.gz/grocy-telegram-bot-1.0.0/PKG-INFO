        **grocy-telegram-bot** is a telegram bot that allows you to receive notifications
        and interact with [Grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy).
        
        # How it works
        
        **grocy-telegram-bot** is a self contained python application that talks
        to your [Grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy) instance via its REST API 
        for which [pygrocy](https://github.com/sebrut/pygrocy) is used.
        
        # How to use
