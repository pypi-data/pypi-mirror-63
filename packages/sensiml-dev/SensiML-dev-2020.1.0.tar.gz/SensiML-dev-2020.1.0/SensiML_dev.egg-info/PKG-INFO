Description: ===========================
        SensiML Python CLient - Dev
        ===========================
        
        SensiML dev python client provides access to SensiML Analytics services for
        building machine learning pipelines including data processing, feature
        generation and classification for developing smart sensor algorithms optimized
        to run on embedded devices. 
        
        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Download the Analytic Studio which will install a python 3 environment  along with all the requirements 
        to run the SensiML Library.
        
            https://sensiml.com/download/
        
        You can also install directly from pypy repository using pip. We recommend  having python >= 3.7
        
            pip install sensiml-dev -U
        
        
        The sensiml dev python client does not include the interactive dashboard version and therefore has a simpler
        install.
