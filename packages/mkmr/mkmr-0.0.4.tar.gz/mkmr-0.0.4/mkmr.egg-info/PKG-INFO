Description: # mkmr
        
        Small python3 utility to create Merge Requests on GitLab, with special support for Alpine Linux's self-hosted instance.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Unless you need the absolutely newest version immediately please use a system package.
        
        This package is available in the testing repo of Alpine Linux
        
        ```
        apk add mkmr
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        mkmr uses INI-formatted files and re-uses the same ones from python-gitlab, in fact it only does some validation to provide useful messages to the user and then passes the configuration file directly for python-gitlab, which is used to do all the API calls required to create the merge request.
        
        The locations searched are:
        
        - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mkmr/config (it will error out instead of looking at the one below)
        - $HOME/.config/mkmr/config (if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set)
        
        The --config switch can be used to pass a full path to a configuration file like so:
        
        ```sh
        $ mkmr --config=/tmp/config
        ```
