        download the tarball from pypi, https://pypi.org/project/botd/#files
        
        if you want to have BOTD started at boot, you need to have the tarball and run:
        
        ::
        
         > sudo bin/install
        
        this will install an botd service in /etc/systemd/system
        
        
        you can also download with pip3 and install globally.
        
        ::
        
         > sudo pip3 install botd --upgrade --force-reinstall
        
        
        
        U S A G E
        
        
        ::
        
         > sudo botd localhost \#dunkbots botje
         > sudo botctl <cmd>
        
        logfiles can be found in /var/log/botd.
        
        
        C O N F I G U R A T I O N
        
        
        use botctl to edit on the system installed botd service:
        
        ::
        
         > sudo botctl cfg krn modules bot.rss,bot.udp
         > sudo botctl cfg irc server localhost
         > sudo botctl cfg irc channel #dunkbots
         > sudo botctl cfg irc nick botje
         > sudo botctl rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
        
        use the -w option if you want to use a different work directory then /var/lib/botd.
        
        
        R S S
        
        
        add an url:
        
        ::
        
         > sudo botctl rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
         ok 1
        
         run the rss command to see what urls are registered:
        
         > sudo botctl rss
         0 https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
        
         the fetch command can be used to poll the added feeds:
        
         > sudo botctl fetch
         fetched 0
        
        
        U D P
        
        
        using udp to relay text into a channel, start the bot with -m bot.udp and use
        the botudp program to send text via the bot to the channel on the irc server:
        
        ::
        
         > tail -f /var/log/botd/botd.log | botudp
