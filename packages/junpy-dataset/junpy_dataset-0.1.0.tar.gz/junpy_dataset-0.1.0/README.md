junpy-dataset contains all files that will be used in unit test, samples and so
on. These may contain large binary data, and these are monitored by git lfs
(Git Large File Storage). For JunPy distribution, this directory is NOT included
to keep the distributed file clean. Instead it is tarballed individually.
