        Created by **RiotKit Collective** as part of WolnoÅ›ciowiec initiative.
        Project initially created for three purposes: 
        
        - To store static files uploaded for users (libertarian/anarchist portal)
        - To store and serve training video files (video archive)
        - To store backups and version those. Limit the disk space and permissions to create a shared space for multiple organizations fighting for human-rights, tenants-rights, working-class rights and animals-rights.
