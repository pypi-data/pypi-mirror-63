# Requirements

In order to use the [Jutge.org](https://jutge.org/) problems toolkit, install first its dependencies: various compilers, Python3, YAML for Python,
LaTeX and various packages of LaTeX. If you intend to use other compilers (e.g. Haskell), you must also install them.


## Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3 texlive-full
```

## Mac

```bash
brew install gcc python3
brew cask install mactex
```

[`brew`](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for Mac.



# Installation

Just install it with `pip3 install jutge-problems-toolkit`. You can update to the latest version with `pip3 install --upgrade jutge-problems-toolkit`. If you want to uninstall it, just type `pip3 uninstall jutge-problems-toolkit`.

In case you are using Anaconda, install with `python3 -m pip install jutge-problems-toolkit`.



# Usage

`jutge-problems-toolkit` is a command line utility that currently supports the following arguments:

- `--executable`: Makes the executables of the problems.
- `--corrects `: Generates the solution files of the problems.
- `--prints`: Creates the printable files in `.pdf` format.
- `--all` : Does everything mentioned above.
- `--recursive`: The toolkit searches recursively for problems.
- `--list`: Lists all the problems found recursively.
- `--srclst`: Lists all the problem sources found recursively.
- `--verify`: Verify the correctness of a program.
- `--help` or `-h` : Shows a help message with available arguments.

To run the toolkit, just type `jutge-problems-toolkit` in the command line.



# Problem structure

A problem is a folder with `.pbm` extension that can be structured in two ways:

### Method 1: test cases and solutions are the same for all human languages

```
└── problem_folder.pbm
	├── handler.yml
	├── problem.ca.tex
	├── problem.ca.yml
	├── problem.en.tex
	├── problem.en.yml
	├── sample.inp
	├── sample.cor
	├── tags.yml
	└── ...
```

### Method 2: different test cases or solutions for different human languages

```
└── problem_folder.pbm
	├── ca
	|	├── handler.yml
	|	├── problem.ca.tex
	|	├── problem.ca.yml
	|	├── sample.inp
	|	├── sample.cor
	|	├── solution.cc
	|	└── ...
	├── en
	|	├── handler.yml
	|	├── problem.en.tex
	|	├── problem.en.yml
	|	├── sample.inp
	|	├── sample.cor
	|	├── solution.cc
	|	└── ...
	└── tags.yml
```

Note: the above structures are just two examples of the structure that a basic problem can have and therefore should only be considered as a guideline. The purpose of all the files is explained later on this file.



# Problem files

A problem should contain the following files:

- `solution.*`: One or more solutions to the problem in different languages. See [Solutions](#solutions) for more information.
- `handler.yml`: Contains the information of how to handle the problem. See [Handler](#handler) for more information.
- `tags.yml`: Contains all the tags associated to the problem as a YAML list of words. Only for instructors, can be left empty. See [Tags](#tags) for more information.
- `*.inp`: All the input test sets. See [Test cases](#test-cases) for more information.
- `*.cor`: All the correct files. Those are generated automatically by the toolkit from the `solution.*` file.  See [Test cases](#test-cases) for more information.
- `problem.lang.tex`: Statement LaTeX file for language `lang`. See [Problem statement](#problem-statement) for more information.
- `problem.lang.yml`: Contains the problem information in language `lang`. See [Problem metadata](#problem-metadata) for more information.
- `problem.lang.pdf`: Formatted PDF statement for language `lang`. These are generated automatically by the toolkit.

Additionally, the problem can contain the following optional files:

- `award.png`: Image of the award users will obtain when they get the problem accepted for the first time. See [Awards](#awards) for more information.
- `award.html`: HTML description of the award users will obtain when they get the problem accepted for the first time. See [Awards](#awards) for more information.
- `code.*`: Code provided in the problem to users that is given as a solution template (a function with blanks to be filled, for example).
- `distiller.yml`:  File used to specify the parameters of the distillation process. See [Distilled test cases](#distilled-test-cases) for more information.
- `scores.yml`: File that describes the scoring of a problem. See [Scoring](#scoring) for more information.
- `*.ops`: File used to specify some limits for the correction of the problem. See [Test options](#test-options) for more information.



## Problem statement

The problem statement is stored using LaTeX in files named `problem.lang.tex`, where `lang` denotes the ISO 639-1 code of the language for which the metadata is given (`ca`,`en`, `es`, ...). Problem statements make use of certain macros defined by [Jutge.org](https://jutge.org/).

### Structure

The typical structure of a problem statement is the following:

```latex
\Problem{The title of the problem using LaTeX}

\Statement

This section provides the statement of the problem.

\medskip

Different paragraphs should be separated by the \medskip command.

\Input

This section describes the input of the problem.

\Output

This section describes the output of the problem.

\Sample

```

The `\Sample` section will be automatically replaced to contain the sample test cases. Alternatively, one can use the `\SampleOneCol` or the `\SampleTwoCol` macros to better adjust the column formatting of the the
sample test cases. `RunPython` users should use `\SampleSession` to get their sample test cases properly formatted as interactive Python sessions.

The title inside the `\Problem{}` macro should match the title in the metadata given in the `problem.lang.yml` file, but on the LaTeX file it can contain math or LaTeX macros.


### Figures

Figures can be inserted using the `\FigureL`, `\FigureC` and `\FigureR` macros, which stand for _left_, _center_ and _right_ respectively. These macros have two parameters:

1. The formatting of the figure (as in `\includegraphics[...]`).
2. The filename of the figure, with no extension. The figure should exists in EPS and PNG formats.

For instance, `\FigureR{width=4.5cm}{towerbell}` will place figure `towerbell` to the right with a width of 4.5 cm.


### Quotes

In order to enclose texts between quotes, please use the `\q{...}` (single quotes), `\qq{...}` (double quotes) or `\uq{...}` (no quotes, but same style) macros.


### Code

The `lstlisting` macros may be used in order to include code. Short snippets of code can be written between `@` signs.

By default, C++ style is used. It may be changed using standard `lstlisting` definitions. The `\UseHaskell` and `\UsePython` macros are shortcuts to use Haskell or Python styling.


### Scoring

In case the problem scores submissions if a test case is passed, we can use `\Scoring` followed by a sentence to explain the scoring method (how many points is worth a case, for example).


### Other sectioning macros

There exist a few other macros that may be used in various situations. Their effect should be straightforward:

- `\Precondition`
- `\Observation`
- `\Observations`
- `\Specification`
- `\Interface`
- `\Hint`
- `\Scores`
- `\Tuples`
- `\ObservationElastic`
- `\ObservationElasticII`
- `\ObservationNoMain`
- `\ObservationNoMainPlural`
- `\ObservationNoMainTuples`
- `\ObservationNoMainTuplesPlural`
- `\ObservationNoMainClasses`


### Other macros

The `\CPP` macro prints C++ in a beautiful way. The `\Link{...}` macro provides an hyperlink to another problem (without specified language), e.g., `\Link{P68688}`.



## Problem metadata

Problem metadata is stored using YAML syntax in files named `problem.lang.yml`, where `lang` denotes the ISO 639-1 code of the language for which the metadata is given (`en`, `es`, `ca`, ...).

In the case that `lang` denotes the original language of the problem, `problem.lang.yml` should contain the following fields:

- `title`: Title of the problem in the original language.
- `author`: Full name of the problem setter.
- `email`: Email of the problem setter.

If `lang` denotes a translation, `problem.lang.yml` should contain the following fields:

- `translator`: Full name of the problem translator.
- `title`: Title of the problem in the translated language.
- `translator_email`: Email of the problem translator.
- `original_language`: Code for the original language of the problem.

A problem should have one unique original language and may have several translations. All translations should refer to the same original language. The system will find the original author through it.

All the values for the metadata fields should be given as Unicode based plain text.

### Examples

`problem.ca.yml`

```yml
title: Suma de dos enters
author: Jordi Petit
email: jpetit@somewhere.mail.com
```

`problem.en.yml`

```yml
title: Sum of two integer numbers
translator: Carlos Molina
translator_email: cmolina@somewhere.mail.com
original_language: ca
```



## Handler

The file `handler.yml` contains the information of how to handle the problem using YAML syntax. These options will tell the toolkit how to compile the problem. The handler must have two options:

- `handler`: `std` (default option) and `graphic` (used by some Python3 problems).
- `source_modifier`: `none` (default option), `structs` (C++ problems that use structs), `no_main` (problems where only a function is requested, in that case you will need to use the optional option `func_name`).

There are also optional arguments that may be used:

- `checker`: Option that will tell [Jutge.org](https://jutge.org/) how to compare the user's program output with the problem solution. See [Checker](#checker) for more information.
- `compilers`: Compiler that [Jutge.org](https://jutge.org/) will use to correct the problem. If specified, this will be the only compiler available on the website if an user wants to send his submission. You will find a list of available compilers in https://jutge.org/documentation/compilers.
- `func_name`: Name of the function requested in case the problem only asks for a function (this must be used along with `source_modifier: no_main`)
- `invisible_main`: If set to `1`, the `main.cc` file will not be provided to users. This is used by problems that do not require to write a `main` function.
- `presentation_error`: If set to `1 ` (by default), the PE (Presentation Error) verdict will be enabled. Otherwise, the verdict will be WA (Wrong Answer) if the files are not identical.
- `solution`: Programming language of the solution that will be used to generate the correct output test cases. By default, if a compiler is specified under `compilers` it will use that language. Otherwise, it will use the C++ solution.

By default, the content of `handler.yml ` should be like this:

````
handler: std
source_modifier: none
````



### Checker

With the `checker` option you can specify how the user's program output is compared with the problem solution. This is especially useful if the order of the output does not matter, for example. There are various `checker` options:

- `std`: The default option, it will just compare the files normally.
- `loosy`: Used for loosy outputs. It is like the standard checker but it will return AC (Accepted) in case a problem gets a PE (Presentation Error) verdict.
- `epsilon`: Used for problems where the output are numbers and can be slightly different than the problem solution. It will check if the user solution is similar to the problem solution. This checker has the following options:
  - `relative`: If set to `1`, the comparison method will be relative. Otherwise, it will be absolute.
- `elastic`: Used to check for outputs whose order is independent. This happens, for instance, for backtracking problems where output order is left without specification. This checker has the following options:
  - `separator`: String that separates one case from another one.
- `elastic2`: Used to check for outputs whose order is independent and the order of these outputs are also independent. This happens, for instance, for subset backtracking problems where output order is left without specification and the order of the subset is also unordered. This checker has the following options:
  - `separator1`:  String that separates one case from another one.
  - `separator2`: String that separates one case inside the case from another one.
  - `starting`: String that starts one case.
  - `ending`: String that ends one case.
- `external`: used to check for outputs using an external program that reads the input and the generated output and writes to `stdout` the verdict. This checker has the following options:
  - `external_program`: Name of the external program used. If the program does not exist, an IE (Internal Error) verdict will be returned.
  - `external_timeout`: Time that the external program has to do its work. The default time is 5 seconds. An IE (Internal Error) verdict will be returned it the program runs for more than the timeout.



## Tags

A list of problem tags are stored using YAML syntax in the file `tags.yml`. Each tag is a short string that specifies a particular aspect of the problem, such as `backtracking` or `interval tree`. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive list of problem tags, but you can see the all the tags that have been used [here](https://jutge.org/instructor/tags/list). Problem tags are only visible by instructor users.

### Examples

`tags.yml`

```yml
- backtracking
- recursion
- event upc contest
- year 2017
```



## Test cases

Each test case `test` is described through two files: `test.inp` and `test.cor`.

`test.inp` contains the input of the test case and `test.cor` contains the correct output of the case. In addition, `test` can also make use of a `test.ops` file to describe some options for its correction.

Test case names should be made of letters, digits, dashes and underscores. Do not use special characters in them. Test cases whose name starts with `sample`, `public`, `hint` or `distilled` have an special meaning and will be explained later on. In the case several of these must be present, they often get names such as `sample-1`, `sample-2`, or `sample-short`.

At correction time, public test cases are corrected before the private ones. The cases are processed sequentially, ordered by their name.

As correcting each single test case causes some overhead, it is not advisable to have many different test cases. 20 different test cases may be a reasonable limit.

Input and output test cases should follow these rules:

- They only contain common characters: digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, punctuation ... (specifically those with ASCII codes between 32 and 126, plus the newline). So, no accents such as `À` or `ü`, no characters such as `ç`, `Δ`, `市` or `😊`, and no tabs.

- All lines should end with a newline character (`\n`), including the last line.

In addition, these rules should be taken into account in the output files:

- There must be no spaces before a line break. In particular, there must be no lines with only one or more spaces before the line break.



### Sample test cases

Sample test cases start with `sample` and will be shown to users in the problem statement and provided to users. As such, they should make clear the format of the input and the output for the problem and should be reasonably short.

#### Public test cases

Public test cases start with `public` and will be provided to users. Usage of public test cases should be rare, but can be useful in situations where long input/output samples must be delivered.


#### Hint test cases

Hint test cases start with `hint` and will be revealed to users if the submission is not accepted (unless some sample test case also fails).

#### Distilled test cases

Distilled test cases start with `distilled` and will be shown to users whose submission fails on them (unless some sample or hint test case also fails). Distilled test cases are created by the system using the [Distiller Algorithm](http://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/28174) and are added automatically to the problem directory, they are not mean to be created or modified by hand.

File `distiller.yml` is used to specify the parameters of the distillation process. `distillation.yml` is used to get some statistics form the distillation process.



### Test options

The `test.ops` file can be used to specify some limits for the correction of the corresponding test case. The options should be written as if they were arguments of a program, with a space between each other. The following options are available:

- `--verbose`: Sets the verbose output level. It has three options: `0` (quiet), `1` (normal) and `2` (all the information).
- `--maxtime`: Sets maximum execution time. It has three values: `cputime`, `limtime` and `clktime`. You can specify only the `cputime`, the `cputime` and the`limtime` or all of them.
  - `cputime` is the maximum time that the program has to use the CPU (processing instructions).
  - `limtime` is the maximum CPU time limit. If not specified, `limtime` will be `cputime+1.5`.
  - `clktime` is the maximum clock time (total time) the program has to run. If not specified, `clktime` will be three times `limtime`.
- `--maxmem`: Set max memory in MB. It has two values: `maxmem` and `maxstack`. `maxmem` is the maximum amount of memory that the program is allowed to use. `maxstack` is the maximum amount of `maxmem` that can be used for the stack. If the `maxstack` is not specified, it will be the same as `maxmem`.
- `--maxfiles`: Sets the maximum number of files that can be open simultaneously.
- `--maxprocs`: Sets the maximum number of processes that the program is allowed to create.
- `--maxoutput`: Sets the maximum file size in MB of the output generated by the program.
- `--maxcore`: Sets the maximum file size in MB of the core file (generated if the program crashes).
- `--basename`: Sets the base name of the input test set.
- `--stdout`: Set path of the output (`.out`) file. If not specified, the output name will be `basename.out`.
- `--stdin`: Set path of the input (`.inp`) file. If not specified, the output name will be `basename.inp`.
- `--stderr`: Set path of the error (`.err`) file. If not specified, the output name will be `basename.err`.
- `--logfile`: Set path of the `.log` file. If not specified, the output name will be `basename.log`.
- `--resfile`: Set path of the `.res` file. If not specified, the output name will be `basename.res`.



## Solutions

Each problem must have, at least, one solution file. Solution files are the reference solutions for the problem statement in various programming languages that will be used to compute the correct outputs for each input test case. Solution files are named `solution.ext`, where `ext` is the standard extension that corresponds to the selected programming language.

For instance, a problem may contain `solution.cc` and `solution.py` in order to provide reference solutions in C++ and Python3.

Independently of the available solutions, users can submit their solutions in any supported programming language. The system will match the programming language of the submission and the programming languages available for the solution and select the most appropriate one.

By default, `jutge-problems-toolkit` uses `solution.cc` to generate the correct output test cases. An alternate programming language can be selected using the `solution` field in the `handler.yml` file. Currently, `jutge-problems-toolkit` supports solutions written in C++, Java, Python, Haskell and R.



## Scores

In order to score submissions according to the correct test cases it passes, `scores.yml` must exist. `scores.yml` describes the scoring of a problem using YAML syntax. The scores are given through a list of partial scores. Each partial score contains the following fields:

- `part`: Identifier of the partial score.
- `prefix`: Prefix of the test cases that must be passed in this partial score.
- `points`: Number of points assigned to this partial score.

The total number of points is usually 100, but other (integer) values can be used.
A submission that receives the totality of points is considered accepted.

### Example

Consider a problem that has the following test cases:

- `sample-1`
- `sample-2`
- `easy-A`
- `easy-B`
- `hard-A`
- `hard-B`
- `hard-C`

The following file gives 10 points to submissions passing all sample test cases, 30 points to submissions passing all easy test cases, and 60 points to submissions passing all hard test cases:

`scores.yml`

```yml
-   part: Samples
    prefix: sample
    points: 10
-   part: Easy
    prefix: easy
    points: 30
-   part: Hard
    prefix: hard
    points: 60
```



## Awards

[Jutge.org](https://jutge.org/) offers awards to users in specific circumstances. Awards are images with a caption and a short description. In the case that a problem contains an image file `award.png` and (optionally) an HTML file `award.html`, users who get the problem accepted for the first time will receive the award.

The `award.png` image file should be a 200x200 pixels image in PNG format with a transparent background (preferably). Clip art and colorful images are preferred, no offensive images should be used.

The `award.html` file should contain a description of the award using simple HTML code. If `award.html` is missing but `award.png` exists, a default description will be provided by the system.
