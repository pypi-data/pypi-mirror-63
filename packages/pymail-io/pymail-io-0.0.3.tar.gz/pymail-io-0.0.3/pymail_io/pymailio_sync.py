    #: PyMailIO is a python library built on CPython's AsyncIO library.
    #: The entree to asyncio is via `PyTaskIO <https://github.com/joegasewicz/pytask-io>`_ which is
    #: an asynchronous task queue library that runs an event loop in a background thread.
    #: Basic Usage. Example::
    #:
    #:    from pymail_io.pymailio_task import Task
    #:
    #:    p = Task(
    #:        password="wizard",
    #:        receiver_email="joe@blogs.com",  # Or a list of emails receiver_email=["joe@blogs.com", ...],
    #:        sender_email="your_email@gmail.com",
    #:        host="smtp.gmail.com",
    #:    )
    #:
    #:    # Create your email subject & body
    #:    email_meta = p.send_email(
    #:        subject="The subject...",
    #:        body="The email body...",
    #:    )
    #:
    #:     # Get a response from your sent email:
    #:     res = p.get_email_response(email_meta)
    #:
    #: Set to False by default. If you want to keep the asyncio task queue running in the background thread
    #: then set this to true.
