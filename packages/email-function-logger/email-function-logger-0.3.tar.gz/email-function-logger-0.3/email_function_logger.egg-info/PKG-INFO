Description: # Email Function Logger
        
        A Python decorator to easily log information about a function and send it to your email.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install email-function-logger
        ```
        
        ## Email setup
        
        You can set the email information as environment variables on your machine. To do this, add the following lines to `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` depending on your OS).
        
        ```bash
        export LOG_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS="example_sender@gmail.com"
        export LOG_SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD="password"
        export LOG_RECEIVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS="example_receiver@gmail.com"
        ```
        
        This step is optional since you can input the information during the function runtime.
        
        ## Example of use
        
        ```python
        from function_logger import log_function
        
        @log_function
        def mult(x, y):
            # Function text output
            print(x)
            print(y)
        
            # Value returned by function
            return x * y
        
        mult(9, 7)
        ```
        
        The log send by email will look like this:
        
        ```
        Subject:
        Function 'mult' execution log
        
        Body:
        Function mult(9, 7) finished its execution.
        
        Start time: Mar 16 18:32:16
        Function text output:
        9
        7
        Function returned: 63
        End time: Mar 16 18:32:16
        
        Total execution time: 00:00:00
        ```
