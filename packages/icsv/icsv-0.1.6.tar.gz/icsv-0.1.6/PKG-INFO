Description: A simple python package to make reading csv files easier.
        This package uses the built-in `csv` module in the backend
        but produces a dict object with the csv file's column headings
        as keys and the column's data as a list for easy manipulation.
        
        If you are familier with the `pandas.read_csv` function. This returns
        something like that.
        
        *Usage*
        ------------------
        ```python
        >>>from icsv.icsv import reader
        >>>df = reader.read('path/to/csv')
        >>>df.keys()
        dict_keys(['key1','key2','key3'])
        >>>df['key1']
        [1,2,3,4,5]
        >>>df['key1'][1] = 7
        >>>df['key1']
        [1,7,3,4,5]
        ```
        Quite simple really and intentionally so.
        Basically, after using the `read` command, you have a normal
        python dictionery, which means everything you can do with dicts
        you can do with the result of `read`. And everything you can do
        with lists, you can do with the result of df[key]
