        This is a sample python language binding for the HPE Composable Fabric Manager

        Installation
        
        
        Currently the pyhpecfm library is not available on Pypi. Manual installation is the only
        method requiring users to first download this git repository locally and then running the install
        command in the pyhpecfm folder where the setup.py is located.
        
        pyhpecfm will be posted to pypi in the future.
        
        `pip install -r requirements.txt`
