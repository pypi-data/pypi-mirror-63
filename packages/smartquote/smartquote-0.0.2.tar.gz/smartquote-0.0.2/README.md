`smartquote` is a very small Python 3.6+ module that does two things:

-   its `substitute` method replaces the four Microsoft "smart quotes"
    characters with their ASCII equivalents
-   its `remove` method removes the smart quotes altogether.

It is written by [Kyle Gorman](kylebgorman@gmail.com).
