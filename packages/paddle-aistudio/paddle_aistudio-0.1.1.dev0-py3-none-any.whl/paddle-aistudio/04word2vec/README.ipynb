        "\n",
        "The source code of this tutorial is in [book/word2vec](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/tree/develop/04.word2vec). For new users, please refer to [Running This Book](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book/blob/develop/README.md#running-the-book) .\n",

        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we'll introduce the vector representation of words, also known as word embedding. Word vector is a common operation in natural language processing. It is a common technology underlying Internet services such as search engines, advertising systems, and recommendation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In these Internet services, we often compare the correlation between two words or two paragraphs of text. In order to make such comparisons, we often have to express words in a way that is suitable for computer processing. The most natural way is probably the vector space model.In this way, each word is represented as a one-hot vector whose length is the dictionary size, and each dimension corresponds to each word in a dictionary, except that the value in the corresponding dimension of the word is 1, other elements are 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "The One-hot vector is natural but has limitation. For example, in the internet advertising system, if the query entered by the user is \"Mother's Day\", the keyword of an advertisement is \"Carnation\". Although according to common sense, we know that there is a connection between these two words - Mother's Day should usually give the mother a bunch of carnations; but the distance between the two words corresponds to the one-hot vectors, whether it is Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, the two words are considered to be irrelevant due to their vector orthogonality. The root cause of this conclusion contradicting us is that the amount of information in each word itself is too small. Therefore, just giving two words is not enough for us to accurately determine whether they are relevant. To accurately calculate correlations, we need more information—knowledge from a large amount of data through machine learning methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the field of machine learning, all kinds of \"knowledge\" are represented by various models, and the word embedding model is one of them. A one-hot vector can be mapped to a lower-dimensional embedding vector by the word embedding model, such as $embedding (Mother's day) = [0.3, 4.2, -1.5, ...], embedding (carnation) = [0.2, 5.6, -2.3, ...]$. In this representation of the embedding vector to which it is mapped, it is desirable that the word vectors corresponding to the similar words on the two semantics (or usages) are \"more like\", such that the cosine similarity of the corresponding word vectors of \"Mother's Day\" and \"Carnation\" is no longer zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "The word embedding model can be a probability model, a co-occurrence matrix model, or a neural network model. Before implementing neural networks to calculate the embedding vector, the traditional method is to count the co-occurrence matrix $X$ of a word. $X$ is a matrix of $|V| \\times |V|$ size, $X_{ij}$ means that in all corpora, The number of words appearing simultaneously with the i-th word and the j-th word in the vocabulary $V$(vocabulary), $|V|$ is the size of the vocabulary. Do matrix decomposition for $X$ (such as singular value decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition \\[[5](#references)\\]), and the result $U$ is treated as the embedding vector for all words:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$X = USV^T$$\n",
        "\n",
        "But such traditional method has many problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Since many words do not appear, the matrix is extremely sparse, so additional processing of the word frequency is needed to achieve a good matrix decomposition effect;\n",
        "\n",
        "2) The matrix is very large and the dimensions are too high (usually up to $10^6 \\times 10^6$);\n",
        "\n",
        "3) You need to manually remove the stop words (such as although, a, ...), otherwise these frequently occurring words will also affect the effect of matrix decomposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "The neural-network-based model does not need to calculate and store a large table that is statistically generated on the whole corpus, but obtains the word vector by learning the semantic information, so the problem above can be well solved. In this chapter, we will show the details of training word vectors based on neural networks and how to train a word embedding model with PaddlePaddle.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Result Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, after the embedding vector is trained, we can use the data visualization algorithm t-SNE\\[[4](#references)\\] to draw the projection of the word features in two dimensions (as shown below). As can be seen from the figure, semantically related words (such as a, the, these; big, huge) are very close in projection, and semantic unrelated words (such as say, business; decision, japan) are far away from the projection.\n",

So we can also calculate the cosine similarity of two word vectors:\n",

        "## Overview of Models\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we introduce three models of training word vectors: N-gram model, CBOW model and Skip-gram model. Their central idea is to get the probability of a word appearing through the context. For the N-gram model, we will first introduce the concept of the language model. In the section [training model](#training model), we'll tutor you to implement it with PaddlePaddle. The latter two models are the most famous neuron word vector models in recent years, developed by Tomas Mikolov in Google \\[[3](#references)\\], although they are very simple, but the training effect is very good.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Language Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Before introducing the word embedding model, let us introduce a concept: the language model.\n",
        "The language model is intended to model the joint probability function $P(w_1, ..., w_T)$ of a sentence, where $w_i$ represents the ith word in the sentence. The goal of the language model isn that the model gives a high probability to meaningful sentences and a small probability to meaningless sentences.Such models can be applied to many fields, such as machine translation, speech recognition, information retrieval, part-of-speech tagging, handwriting recognition, etc., All of which hope to obtain the probability of a continuous sequence. Take information retrieval as an example, when you search for \"how long is a football bame\" (bame is a medical term), the search engine will prompt you if you want to search for \"how long is a football game\", because the probability of calculating \"how long is a football bame\" is very low, and the word is similar to bame, which may cause errors, the game will maximize the probability of generating the sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the target probability of the language model $P(w_1, ..., w_T)$, if it is assumed that each word in the text is independent, the joint probability of the whole sentence can be expressed as the product of the conditional probabilities of all the words. which is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(w_1, ..., w_T) = \\prod_{t=1}^TP(w_t)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we know that the probability of each word in the statement is closely related to the word in front of it, so in fact, the language model is usually represented by conditional probability:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(w_1, ..., w_T) = \\prod_{t=1}^TP(w_t | w_1, ... , w_{t-1})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### N-gram neural model\n",
        "\n",
        "In computational linguistics, n-gram is an important text representation method that represents a continuous n items in a text. Each item can be a letter, word or syllable based on the specific application scenario. The n-gram model is also an important method in the statistical language model. When n-gram is used to train the language model, the nth word is generally predicted by the content of the n-1 words of each n-gram.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scientists such as Yoshua Bengio introduced how to learn a word vector model of a neural network representation in the famous paper Neural Probabilistic Language Models \\[[1](#references)\\ in 2003. The Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) in this paper connects the linear model and a nonlinear hidden layer. It learns the language model and the word vector simultaneously, that is, by learning a large number of corpora to obtain the vector expression of the words, and the probability of the entire sentence is obtained by using these vectors. Since all words are represented by a low-dimensional vector, learning the language model in this way can overcome the curse of dimensionality.\n",
        "Note: Because the \"Neural Network Language Model\" is more general, we do not use the real name of NNLM here, considering its specific practice, this model here is called N-gram neural model.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have already mentioned above using the conditional probability language model, that is, the probability of the $t$ word in a sentence is related to the first $t-1$ words of the sentence. The farther the word actually has the smaller effect on the word, then if you consider an n-gram, each word is only affected by the preceding `n-1` words, then:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(w_1, ..., w_T) = \\prod_{t=n}^TP(w_t|w_{t-1}, w_{t-2}, ..., w_{t-n+1 })$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Given some real corpora, these corpora are meaningful sentences, and the optimization goal of the N-gram model is to maximize the objective function:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_t f(w_t, w_{t-1}, ..., w_{t-n+1};\\theta) + R(\\theta)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $f(w_t, w_{t-1}, ..., w_{t-n+1})$ represents the conditional probability of getting the current word $w_t$ based on historical n-1 words, $R(\\theta )$ represents a parameter regularization item.\n",

        "\n",
        " - Then the word vectors of all words are spliced into a large vector, and a hidden layer representation of the historical words is obtained through a non-linear mapping:\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        " - According to the definition of softmax, by normalizing $g_i$, the probability of generating the target word $w_t$ is:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "   where $y_k^i$ represents the real label (0 or 1) of the $i$ sample of the $k$ class, and $softmax(g_k^i)$ represents the probability of the kth softmax output of the i-th sample.\n",

In information retrieval, we can judge the correlation between query and document keywords based on the cosine value between vectors. In syntactic analysis and semantic analysis, trained word vectors can be used to initialize the model for better results. In the document classification, after the word vector, you can cluster to group synonyms in a document, or you can use N-gram to predict the next word. We hope that everyone can easily use the word vector to conduct research in related fields after reading this chapter.\n",
