Description: # ShellyPy
        not to be confused with [pyShelly](https://github.com/StyraHem/pyShelly)  
        Python 2 and 3 Wrapper around the Shelly HTTP api
        
        
        ## why
        other packages like [pyShelly](https://github.com/StyraHem/pyShelly) only support CoAP or MSQT, neither I am comfortable with using in personal projects
        
        
        ## example
        here is a simple working example for the Shelly 1 that turns a relay on
        ```python
        import ShellyPy
        
        device = ShellyPy.Shelly("192.168.0.5")
        
        device.relay(0, turn=True)
        ```
        this example with comments can be found on [examples/toggle_relay.py](examples/toggle_relay.py)
        
        ## devices
        #### supported
        - Shelly1
        - Shelly1PM

        #### unsupported
        - Shelly Sense (documentation is inaccurate, incomplete)
        - Shelly RGBW (documentation is incomplete)
        
        ## applicability
        this wrapper is best used in closed networks where other solutions are either not an option or not desired  
        give your shelly devices static IP adresses for best results
