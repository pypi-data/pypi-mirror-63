About Harvester
###############

Harvester was created to be a friendly image acquisition library for all people who those want to learn computer/machine vision. Harvester consists of two Python libraries, Harvester Core and Harvester GUI, and technically speaking, each library is responsible for the following tasks:

Harvester Core:

- Image acquisition
- Remote device manipulation

Harvester GUI:

- Image data visualization

Harvester consumes image acquisition libraries, so-called GenTL Producers. Just grabbing a GenTL Producer and GenICam compliant machine vision cameras, then Harvester will supply you the acquired image data as `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ array to make your image processing task productive.

You can freely use, modify, distribute Harvester under `Apache License-2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ without worrying about the use of your software: personal, internal or commercial.

Currently, Harvester is being developed by the motivated contributors from all over the world.

***********************
Where is the name from?
***********************

Harvester's name was coming from the great Flemish painter, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's painting so-called "The Harvesters". Harvesters harvest a crop every season that has been fully grown and the harvested crop is passed to the consumers. On the other hand, image acquisition libraries acquire images as their crop and the images are passed to the following processes. We found the similarity between them and decided to name our library Harvester.

Apart from anything else, we love its peaceful and friendly name. We hope you also like it ;-)

Terminology
###########

Before start talking about the detail, let's take a look at some important terminologies that frequently appear in this document. These terminologies are listed as follows:

* **The GenApi-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with the GenICam reference implementation.

* **A GenTL Producer**: A library that has C interface and offers consumers a way to communicate with cameras over physical transport layer dependent technology hiding the detail from the consumer.

* **The GenTL-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with GenTL Producers.

* **Harvester**: A Python module that consists of Harvester Core and Harvester GUI.

* **Harvester Core**: A part of Harvester that works as an image acquisition engine.

* **Harvester GUI**: A part of Harvester that works as a graphical user interface of Harvester Core.

* **A GenICam compliant remote device**: It's typically a camera. Just involving the GenICam reference implementation, it offers consumers a way to dynamically configure/control the target remote devices.

The following diagram shows the hierarchy and relationship of the relevant modules:

Installation
############

In this section, we will learn how to instruct procedures to get Harvester work.

*******************
System Requirements
*******************

The following software modules are required to get Harvester working:

* Either of Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7

In addition, you will need the following items to let Harvester make something meaningful:

* GenTL Producers
* GenICam compliant machine vision cameras

***************************
Supported operating systems
***************************

Harvester has been tested with the following operating systems:

* macOS 10.13
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 7.4
* Windows 7

************************
Installing Harvester GUI
************************

If you want to use Harvester GUI, then please invoke the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install harvesters_gui

Note that ``PyQt5`` is distributed under LGPL and it may not be ideal for your purpose. In the future, we might support other GUI frameworks which are more or less open and free.

***********************
Launching Harvester GUI
***********************

To launch Harvester GUI, let's create a Python script file, naming ``harvester.py``, that contains the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from harvesters_gui.frontend.pyqt5 import Harvester

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = QApplication(sys.argv)
        h = Harvester()
        h.show()
        sys.exit(app.exec_())

Then launch ``harvester.py``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python path/to/harvester.py

You will see Harvester GUI pops up.

###########################
How does Harvester GUI us?
###########################

Harvester GUI works on the top of Harvester Core and offers you high-performance image data visualization on the fly. It involves VisPy for controlling OpenGL functionality and PyQt for providing GUI.

The main features of Harvester GUI are listed as follows:

* Image data visualization of the acquired images
* Image magnification using a mouse wheel or a trackpad
* Image dragging using a mouse or a trackpad
* An arbitrary selection of image displaying point in the data path (Not implemented yet)

Unlike Harvester Core, Harvester GUI limits the number of GenTL Producers to load just one. This is just a limitation to not make the GUI complicated. In general, the user should know which GenTL Producer should be loaded to control his target remote device. It's not necessary to load multiple GenTL Producers for this use case. However, this is just an idea in an early stage. We might support multiple loading on even Harvester GUI in the future.

*****************************************
Pixel formats that Harvester GUI supports
*****************************************

Currently, Harvester GUI supports the following pixel formats that are defined by the Pixel Format Naming Convention:

    ``Mono8``, ``Mono10``, ``Mono12``, ``Mono16``, ``RGB8``, ``RGBa8``, ``BayerRG8``, ``BayerGR8``, ``BayerBG8``, ``BayerGB8``, ``BayerRG16``, ``BayerGR16``, ``BayerBG16``, ``BayerGB16``

Note that Harvester GUI has not yet supported demosaicing.

###########
Screenshots
###########

In this section, we see some useful windows which Harvester GUI offers you.

****************************
Image data visualizer window
****************************

The image data visualizer window (below) offers you a visualization of the acquired images. In this screenshot, Harvester is acquiring a 4000 x 3000 pixel of RGB8 image at 30 fps; it means it's acquiring images at 8.6 Gbps. It's quite fast, isn't it?

    :alt: Image data visualizer

***************************
Attribute controller window
***************************

The attribute controller window (below) offers you to manipulate GenICam feature nodes of the target remote device. Changing exposure time, triggering the target remote device for image acquisition, storing a set of camera configuration so-called User Set, etc, you can manually control the target remote device anytime when you want to. It supports the visibility filter feature and regular expression feature. These features are useful in a case where you need to display only the features you are interested in.
