        ## The tools
        
        svmap
        
        	this is a sip scanner. When launched against
        	ranges of ip address space, it will identify any SIP servers 
        	which it finds on the way. Also has the option to scan hosts 
        	on ranges of ports.
        
        svwar
        
        	identifies working extension lines on a PBX. A working 
        	extension is one that can be registered. 
        	Also tells you if the extension line requires authentication or not. 
        
        svcrack
        	
        	a password cracker making use of digest authentication. 
        	It is able to crack passwords on both registrar servers and proxy 
        	servers. Current cracking modes are either numeric ranges or
        	words from dictionary files.
        
        svreport
        
        	able to manage sessions created by the rest of the tools
        	and export to pdf, xml, csv and plain text.
        
        svcrash
        	
        	responds to svwar and svcrack SIP messages with a message that
        	causes old versions to crash. 
        
        For usage help make use of `-h` or `--help` switch.
