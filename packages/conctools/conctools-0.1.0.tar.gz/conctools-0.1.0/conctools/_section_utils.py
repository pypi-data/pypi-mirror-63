                           lambda_c=0.8):
    '''Return the compression block and the remainder of the compression zone.

    The compression zone is split into two parts:

        - compression block
        - remaining zone

    The line that splits the zone is created from a translation of the neutral
    axis. The translation is such that the height of the compression block
    becomes `lambda_c * x`, where `x` denoted the height of the entire
    compression zone that was inputted.
    This operation is used for analysis of a failure state of the cross section.

    Parameters
    ----------
    compression zone : shapely Polygon object
        The part of the cross section that is in compression.
    neutral axis : shapely LineString object
        A line representing the neutral axis of the cross section.
    A_gross : number
        The area of the entire uncracked concrete cross section.
    lambda_c : number, optional
        Coefficient for compression block height compared to compression
        zone height when examining a failure state of the cross section.
        .lambda_c * x, where x is entire height of compression zone.
        Must be less than 1.0. Defaults to 0.8 as per EN 1992-1-1.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        Tuple of two Shapely Polygon objects with the compression zone and the
        remainder as first and second element, respectively.

    Theory
    ------
    The compression zone in a failure state analysis consists of a compression
    block which has a height of `lambda_c * x` and a constant stress of `-fcd`
    (if the most common standard stress distribution is adopted). The
    remaining part of the compression zone with height `(1 - lambda_c) * x` is
    the "dead zone" or "remainder", which is not considered to have concrete
    in compression. This zone might have rebars in compression though.

    Note that in the a where the entire section is in full compression and the
    neutral axis just outside of the section, the compression block might not
    take up the entire section.
