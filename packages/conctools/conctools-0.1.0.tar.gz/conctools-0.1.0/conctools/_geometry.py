    polygon : polygon object

def evaluate_points(x, y, angle_deg, y_intersect):
    '''Return a boolean array indicating whether each point is above the line.

    The returned array has elements True or False depending on whether the
    point is above or below the line, respectively.

    Points that are exactly on the line will evaluate to True.

    Parameters
    ----------


    Returns
    -------
    array
        Array of evaluation values for each input point

    Theory
    ------
    A straight line is defined as

            y = a * x + b

    Given a point P(x, y), the point can be evaluated by use of the line as

            point_evaluation = a * x + b - y

    The line orientation is such that points above the line will evaluate to
    positive values if

        0 < `angle_deg` < 90    and     270 < `angle_deg` < 360

    And negative values if

       90 < `angle_deg` < 270

    After this evaluation the values are converted to True and
    False where True will always mean 'above' the line.
