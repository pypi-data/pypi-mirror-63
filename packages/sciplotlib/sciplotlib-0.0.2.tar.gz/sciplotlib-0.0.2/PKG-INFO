Description: # sciplotlib
        
        
        ## sciplotlib is just a set of simple functions and stylesheets for more professional looking plots 
        
        ![nature review style shading scatter](./figures/nature-review-style-shading.svg)
        
        There are two main properties that make plots in papers look the way they do: 
        
         1. default style properties such as typeface, color scheme, 
         2. specific choices in terms of the placement of tick marks, or additional elements that are added to the plot such as shading or shadows 
        
        sciplotlib aims to make (1) easier by providing stylesheets that aims to mimic the style properties found in scientific papers: 
        
        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as np
        from sciplotlib import style as spstyle
        
        def make_plot(ax):
        
        	num_categories = 10
        	num_points = 10
        	for category in num_categories:
        		x = np.random.normal(size=num_points)
        		y = np.radnom.normal(size=num_points)
        		ax.scatter(x, y)
        
        	return ax 
        	
        
        
        
        ```
         
        
        
        ## Installation 
        
        Simply do 
        
        `pip install sciplotlib`
        
        
        ## Acknowledgments
        
        sciplotlib is built on top of matplotlib. To cite matplotlib in your publications, cite:

        Other projects that is also built on the idea of providing stylesheets / wrappers for scientific plots include:

        Color palettes of scientific papers are obtained from the wonderful `ggsci` library:
