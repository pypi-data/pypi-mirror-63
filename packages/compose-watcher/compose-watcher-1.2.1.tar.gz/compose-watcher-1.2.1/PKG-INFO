        Cli that restarts you docker compose services when a file inside one of its volumes changes
        Useful for faster developement with containers that expose behaviour based on mounted files
        To use with compiled languages place the compilation step in the `command` field.
        
        Example usage
        
        -   graphql api restart when schema file changes
        -   graphql api mocks based on schema file ([https://github.com/remorses/graphql-easy-mocks](like this one))
        -   Every container that generates code and exposes a server based on a config file
        -   Nodejs container restarts when the src folder changes, recompiling with tsc
        -   [Mongoke](https://github.com/remorses/mongoke) restarts when config schema changes
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip3 install compose-watcher
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Use the directories you want to track as service volumes
        Also consider using `init: true` in the compose service definition for faster killing of processes.
        To not stop the `docker-compose logs` command, there should be always a running container
        
        ```
        version: '3'
        
        services:
          api:
            build: node_api
            command: sh -c 'tsc --incremental && node index.js'
            volumes:
              - ./node_api/src:/src
        
        ```
        
        Then execute `compose-watcher` to watch changes
        
        ```
        compose-watcher -f docker-compose.yml --timeout 5
        ```
        
        TODO add extension filter
        TODO dont block the event receiving thread when restarting
        
        ## How it works
        
        After running the `compose-watcher` command all the volumes mounted on every service are tracked for change, when a change happens the service where the volume is mounted is restarted toghether with the services in the `depends_on` filed. Then the other services that have the restarted service as a dependency in `depends_on` are restarted too
