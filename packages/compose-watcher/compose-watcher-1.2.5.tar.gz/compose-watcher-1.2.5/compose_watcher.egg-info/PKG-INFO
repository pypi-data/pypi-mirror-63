        Cli that restarts you docker compose services when a file inside one of its volumes changes.
        
        Useful for faster developement with containers that expose behaviour based on mounted files.
        
        Example usage
        
        -   graphql api restart when schema file changes
        -   graphql api mocks based on schema file ([like this one](https://github.com/remorses/graphql-easy-mocks))
        -   Every container that generates code and exposes a server based on a config file
        -   Nodejs container restarts when the src folder changes, recompiling with tsc
        -   [Mongoke](https://github.com/remorses/mongoke) restarts when config schema changes
        
        ## Install
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install compose-watcher
        # then you can watch for changes
        compose-watcher -f docker-compose.yml
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Use the directories you want to track as service volumes.
        
        Also consider using `init: true` in the compose service definition for faster killing of processes.
        
        To not stop the `docker-compose` commands on other terminals there should be always a running container (this is a strange fact about docker-compose).
        
        ```
        version: '3'
        
        services:
          api:
            build: .
            command: sh -c 'tsc --incremental && node index.js'
            volumes:
              - ./src:/src
        
        ```
        
        Then execute `compose-watcher` to watch changes.
        
        ```sh
        compose-watcher -f docker-compose.yml --timeout 5
        ```
        
        TODO add extension filter
        
        ## How it works
        
        After running the `compose-watcher` command all the volumes mounted on every service are tracked for change, when a change happens the service where the volume is mounted is restarted toghether with the services in the `depends_on` filed. Then the other services that have the restarted service as a dependency in `depends_on` are restarted too.
