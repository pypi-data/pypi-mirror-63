A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) library that can work with complex numbers.


# Development

For dependency management and publishing to [Pypi](https://pypi.org/) we use
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

If you want to extend `gpr_complex`, clone it from the
[git repository](https://github.com/darcamo/gpr_complex), run
`poetry install` to create the virtual environment with the required
dependencies and run `pre-commit install` to install the commit hooks.
