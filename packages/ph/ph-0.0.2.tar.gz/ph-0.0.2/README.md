# ph - the tabular data shell tool

Using the _pipeline_ in Linux is nothing short of a dream in the life of the
computer super user.

However the pipe is clearly most suited for a stream of lines of textual data,
and not when the stream is actually tabular data.

Tabular data is much more complex to work with due to its dual indexing and the
fact that we often read horizontally and often read vertically.

The defacto format for tabular data is `csv` (which is not perfect in any sense
of the word), and the defacto tool for working with tabular data in Python is
Pandas.

This is a shell utility `ph` that reads tabular data from standard in and allows
you to perform a pandas function on the data, before writing it to standard out
in `csv` format.

The goal is to create a tool which makes it nicer to work with tabular data in a
pipeline.
