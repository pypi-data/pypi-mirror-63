Description: # BxTorch
        
        BxTorch is a high-level library for large-scale machine learning in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
        It is engineered both to cut obsolete boilerplate code while preserving the flexibility of PyTorch to create just about any deep learning model.
        
        ## Installation
        
        BxTorch is available on PyPi, so simply run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip install bxtorch
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        Generally, BxTorch provides an object-oriented approach to abstracting
        PyTorch's API. The core design objective is to provide an API both as simple
        and as extensible as possible. The goal of this library is to be able to iterate between different models easily instead of squeezing out milliseconds
        where it is not required.
        
        Still, being focused on large-scale machine learning, BxTorch aims to make it
        as easy as possible working with large datasets. This includes out-of-the-box
        multi-GPU support where the user *does not need to write a single line of
        code*. Currently, BxTorch only provides means for running training/inference
        on a single machine. In case this is insufficient, you might be better off
        using PyTorch's `distributed` package directly.
        
        It must be emphasized that BxTorch is not meant to be a wrapper for PyTorch as
        Keras is for TensorFlow - it only provides *extensions*.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Examples of the usage of BxTorch can be found in the [docs folder](docs).
        Method documentation is currently only available as [docstrings](bxtorch).
