# BWA used to remove a contaminant

# :Parameters:

# - do: if unchecked, this rule is ignored
# - reference_file: the name of the reference file to be found
#        in the analysis directory. If set to phiX174.fa,
#        it is downloaded automatically from Sequana, otherwise you will
#        need to copy it yourself in the working directory.
# - index_algorithm: the BWA index algorithm
# - options: any options recognised by BWA tool
# - threads: number of threads to be used

# Quality trimming and adapter removal
#
# If a design_file is provided the forward and reverse complement adapters
# are automatically extracted from this file (given the sample name contained
# in the filenames). In such case, the fwd and rev fields are ignored.
#
# If there is no design_file, the fwd and rev fields are used. It can be a
# string, or a filename. If a filename, it must be prefixed with "file:" to
# specify that it is a file and not a string. If the tool is cutadapt, the empty
# fwd and rev fields means that no adapters are to be used.
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - adapter_choice: to be used with a design_file only (see below for valid values)
# - design_file: a valid CSV file with mapping of index and sample name
# - fwd: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - m: 20 means discard trimmed reads that are shorter than 20.
#         must be > 0
# - quality: 0 means no trimming, 30 means keep base with quality
#        above 30
# - mode: must be set to one of
#     - g for 5'
#     - a for 3'
#     - b for both 5'/3'
# - rev: a string or file (prefixed with *file:*)
# - tool: only cutadapt supported for now
# - threads: number of threads to use (atropos only)
# - options: See cutadapt documentation for details on
#            cutadapt.readthedocs.io. We change the default value
#            of -O to 6 (at least 6 bases are required to match before
#            trimming of an adapter)
