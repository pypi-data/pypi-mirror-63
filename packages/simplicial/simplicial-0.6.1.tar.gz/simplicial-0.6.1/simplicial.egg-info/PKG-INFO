Description: simplicial: Simplicial topology in Python
        =========================================
        
        This package arose from explorations of using ideas from algebraic
        topology in the context of wireless sensor networks, to tackle
        problems like target tracking and estimation of the goodness-of-fit of
        interpolations from isolated observations. Its main contribution is to
        represent and manipulate simplicial complexes, topological structures
        describing spaces built from cells.
