Description: ### About allhub
        
        `allhub` is a REST API library for Github REST API v3 written in python. Currently, this library is under heavy
        development.  Maybe i will cut a release once i am confident that major part of the library covered with tests.
        
        
        ### Features
        
        1. `allhub` is heavily inspired by Javascript, meaning that you can access the properties on JSON
        object either object.prop or object["prop"]. I feel the later version is kind of verbose, and I recommend
        you use the object.prop.
        
        2. I have seen most of the Github libraries are not covered comprehensively. But this library aims to covers 
        all of REST API v3.
        
        3. I have designed this library keeping programmer ergonomics in mind, so that you create only one object
         to access any of the API.

        ### Examples
        ```python
        from allhub import AllHub
        allhub = AllHub(
        "username",
        "tokenxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "app_tokenxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "password"
        )
        response = allhub.xxxxxxxxx()
        ```
        
        ## TODO
        
        `allhub` requires some love. Currently, unit tests are almost non existent. Love to take the coverage to 100%.
        But I am severely limited by time and priorities. If someone wants to send unit tests, please fork and
        send the patch away.
        
        You are more than welcome.
