# Finicity can usually determine the correct type for each account, but in some
# rare cases the account type will be unknown. In these cases, the account
# number and name should be displayed to the customer, who must specify the
# correct account type by selecting a value from the following table.
# Calls to Activate Customer Accounts v2 (without Aggregation) will fail if the
# account's  field contains unknown or any unrecognized type designation. The
# failed request will return HTTP 400 (Bad Request) with the error code 10106
# (Invalid Account Type).
