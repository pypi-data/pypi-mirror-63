        Generate a Verification of Assets (VOA) report for all checking, savings, money market, and investment accounts for the given customer. This service retrieves up to six months of transaction history for each account and uses this information to generate the VOA report.
        This is a premium service. The billing rate is the variable rate for Verification of Assets under the current subscription plan. The billable event is the successful generation of a VOA report.
        A report consumer must be created for the given customer before calling Generate VOA Report (see Report Consumers).
        After making this call, the client app may wait for a notification to be sent to the Report Listener Service, or it may enter a loop, which should wait 20 seconds and then call the service Get Report to see if the report is finished. While the report is being generated, Get Report will return a minimal report with status inProgress. The loop should repeat every 20 seconds until Get Report returns a different status.

        HTTP status of 202 (Accepted) means the report is being generated. When the report is finished, a notification will be sent to the specified report callback URL, if specified.

Extending the epoch timestamp beyond 10 digits will default back to six months of data
