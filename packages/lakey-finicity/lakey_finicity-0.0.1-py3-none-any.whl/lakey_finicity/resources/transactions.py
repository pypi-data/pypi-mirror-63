        Connect to the account's financial institution and load up to twelve months of historic transactions for the account. For some institutions, up to two years of history may be available.
        This is a premium service. The billing rate is the variable rate for Cash Flow Verification under the current subscription plan. The billable event is a call to this service specifying a customerId that has not been seen before by this service. (If this service is called multiple times with the same customerId, to load transactions from multiple accounts, only one billable event has occurred.)
        HTTP status of 204 means historic transactions have been loaded successfully. The transactions are now available by calling Get Customer Account Transactions.
        HTTP status of 203 means the responses contains an MFA challenge. Contact your Account Manager or Systems Engineers to determine the best route to handle this HTTP status code.
        The recommended timeout setting for this request is 180 seconds in order to receive a responses. However you can terminate the connection after making the call the operation will still complete. You will have to pull the account records to check for an updated aggregation attempt date to know when the refresh is complete.
        This service usually requires the HTTP header Content-Length: 0 because it is a POST request with no request body.
        The date range sent to the institution is calculated from the account's createdDate. This means that calling this service a second time for the same account normally will not add any new transactions for the account. For this reason, a second call to this service for a known accountId will usually return immediately with HTTP 204.
        In a few specific scenarios, it may be desirable to force a second connection to the institution for a known accountId. Some examples are:
        The institution's policy has changed, making more transactions available.
        Finicity has now added Cash Flow Verification support for the institution.
        The first call encountered an error, and the resulting Aggregation Ticket has now been fixed by the Finicity Support Team.
        In these cases, the POST request can contain the parameter force=true in the request body to force the second connection.

        To recover an account that has state 185 or 187, call Refresh Institution Login Accounts during an interactive session with the customer, prompt the customer with the MFA challenge that is returned from that call, and then send that responses to Refresh Institution Login Accounts (with MFA Answers).

Apps may call Refresh services for a specific customer when the customer opens the app, or when the customer directly invokes a Refreshaction from the app.
