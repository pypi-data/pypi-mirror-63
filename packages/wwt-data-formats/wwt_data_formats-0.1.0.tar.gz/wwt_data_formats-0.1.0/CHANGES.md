# 0.1.0 (2020-Mar-17)

- Massive infrastructure rebuild. We now use traitlets and have a framework

  now deserialize folders and their contents.

# 0.0.2 (2020-Feb-05)

- Document the FileCabinet support
- Work with FITS files that have `CDELT{1,2}` but not `PC1_1` and `PC2_2`.
- Removed Python 2.7 from the CI.

- First version
