# A station name aliases preset is a map from the "official"
# station names stored in the archive database to lists of aliases
# for them that can appear in recording file names. The archive
# station names should be capitalized exactly they are in the
# archive. The capitalization of aliases is irrelevant since they
# and the station names that appear in file names are converted to
# lower case before comparison.
#
# The example preset below has been commented out to disable
# it. To enable the preset, remove the two-character sequence
# "# " (i.e. a pound sign followed by a space) from the beginning
# of each line of the preset.
# Ithaca:
#     - ith
#     - ith000
