        # wrong samples. For example, suppose that this method is called
        # on separate threads for two different clips, clips 1 and 2,
        # that are in the same file and hence will use the same file
        # reader. We want the seek and read operations for the two clips
        # to be ordered like this:
        #
        #     1. Seek clip 1.
        #     2. Read clip 1.

        # (or perhaps with operations 3 and 4 preceding 1 and 2). If we
        # don't make the seek/read combinations atomic, however, we can
        # get this instead:
        #
        #     1. Seek clip 1.
        #     2. Seek clip 2.
