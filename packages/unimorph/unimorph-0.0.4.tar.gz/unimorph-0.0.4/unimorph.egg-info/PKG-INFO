        The [Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project](https://unimorph.github.io) is a collaborative 
        effort to improve how NLP handles complex morphology in the worldâ€™s 
        languages. The goal of UniMorph is to annotate morphological data
        in a universal schema that allows an inflected word from any 
        language to be defined by its lexical meaning, typically carried 
        by the lemma, and by a rendering of its inflectional form in terms 
        of a bundle of morphological features from our schema. The 
        specification of the schema is described in [Sylak-Glassman (2016)](http://www.unimorph.org/doc/Sylak-Glassman_2016_-_UniMorph_Schema_User_Guide.pdf).
        
        ---
        
        This tool provides turnkey command-line access to morphological annotations in over 100 languages.
        
        To install the UniMorph Python extension, install it from PyPI:
        
         ```bash
         pip3 install unimorph
         ```
        
        The tool will then be available to you from the command-line as `unimorph`. To see the features available, run `unimorph --help`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Query the available UniMorph languages' ISO 639-3 codes.
        
        ```bash
        unimorph list
        ```
        
        Give the complete paradigm for a lemma.
        
        ```bash
        unimorph inflect --word recken --lang deu
        ```
        
        Get a particular form of the lemma.
        
        ```bash
        unimorph inflect --word recken --features V;IND;PRS;2;SG --lang deu
        ```
        
        Analyze a word form: What are its lemma and features?
        
        ```bash
        unimorph analyze --word gereckt --lang deu
        ```
        
        (You can also use short param names.)
        
        ```bash
        unimorph analyze -w gereckt -l deu
        ```
        
        Records in UniMorph's inflectional databases cannot hope to exhaustively cover a language's lexicon, especially in light of novel words. If a word is missing, let us know.
        
        ## Contribution
        
        UniMorph is an open project! We want you!
        
        Found a bug? Want to contribute source code? Submit an issue or pull request to the appropriate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/unimorph). Language-specific corrections or additions should be marked in their corresponding repository; improvements to the `unimorph` command-line tool should be noted in the [`unimorph` repository](https://github.com/unimorph/unimorph).

        ## Advanced usage
        
        `unimorph` stores language databases in a default location. This can be overridden by setting the shell environment variable `UNIMORPH` to the preferred folder.
