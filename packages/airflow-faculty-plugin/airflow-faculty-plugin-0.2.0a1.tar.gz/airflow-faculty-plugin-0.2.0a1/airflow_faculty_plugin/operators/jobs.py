    Parameters
    ----------
    job_id : str
        ID of the job to trigger
    project_id : str
        Project ID of the job to trigger
    polling_period_seconds : int, optional
        The number of seconds between checks for whether the job has
        completed. Use a low number if you expect the job to finish
        quickly, and a high number if the job is longer. Defaults to
        30s.
    job_parameter_values : dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping parameter names to the values they should take
    task_id : str
        Identifier for the Airflow task triggered by this job
    client_configuration: dict, optional
        The configuration with which to connect to the Faculty API.
        Use this to customise how to connect to Faculty. Refer to the
        docstring for the `client` method for a full description of parameters:
