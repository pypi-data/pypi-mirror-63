Welcome to Manila's developer documentation!
============================================

Manila is an OpenStack project to provide "Shared Filesystems as a service".

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault-Tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open Standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree. Additional draft and project documentation on Manila and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_. Cloud administrators, refer to `docs.openstack.org`_.
