Description: # megachonker
        Use `megachonker` for optimizing the backup of large files. 
        
        Requires the `tqdm` python package: `pip3 install tqdm`
        
        ## usage
        ```
        usage: megachonker [-h] [-q] in_file out_file
        
        Use megachonker for optimizing the backup of large files. megachonker dissects large
        file objects into 1MB chunks and it hashes each chunk. Each hash is then
        compared to a hash for the respective chunk in the previous version of the
        file. The chunk gets copied into the old file and backed up iff hashes differ.
        A file <out_file>.hashes will be stored alongside the backed up file.
        
        positional arguments:
          in_file      This is the file to be chunked, hashed and copied
          out_file     This is the backed up version of the file
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help   show this help message and exit
          -q, --quiet  Do not show any output.
          ```
