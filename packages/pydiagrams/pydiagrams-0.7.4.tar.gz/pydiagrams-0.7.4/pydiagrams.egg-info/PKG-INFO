Description: # pydiagrams
        
        pydiagrams is a tool to generate software diagrams by using Python as a DSL.
        pydiagrams providers a framework for describing a software diagram as python code, and translating into it source code specific to a rendering program.
        
        It can generate the following types of diagrams:
        * Flowcharts
        * Database "View" diagrams / Data flow diagrams
        * UML Component diagrams
        * Integration Architecture diagrams
        
        These diagrams are can be generated via a choice of rendering programs:
        * [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
        * [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)
        * [yEd (as GraphML)](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed)
        * [Blockdiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/)
        
        ## Motivation
        Diagram generation languages (such as PlantUML, Graphviz, Blockdiag) provide general-purpose diagrams, but require the user to learn a specific syntax. 
        They each have certain strengths and weaknesses that sometimes require switching from one format to another.
        pydiagrams instead provides a simple python-DSL that allows the user to write a single diagram that is can then be translated into the rendering program of choice.
