Toolset for granular memory and cpu live profiling



Similar products

- Syrpy https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/Syrupy 
- Scalene https://github.com/emeryberger/scalene

Problems
--------
Either you have a cli tool that profiles memory and cpu, but **no code api for granular data** 

or you have stuff like decorators and **no memory profiling**

Having a live dashboard would help also, use https://github.com/libvis for that
