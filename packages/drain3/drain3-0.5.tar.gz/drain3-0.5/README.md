# Drain3
## Introduction

Drain3 is an online log parser that can parse logs into structured events in a streaming and timely manner. It employs a parse tree with fixed depth to guide the log group search process, which effectively avoids constructing a very deep and unbalanced tree.

Drain3 continuously learns and automatically generates "log templates" from raw log entries. As an example for the input:

```
> 10:00 connect to 10.0.0.1
> 10:10 connect to 10.0.0.2
> 10:20 connect to 10.0.0.3
> 10:30 Hex number 0xDEADBEAF
> 10:30 Hex number 0x10000
> 10:40 executed cmd "print"
> 10:50 executed cmd "sleep"
```
Drain3 generates the following templates:

```
> {"cluster_id": "A0001", "cluster_count": 1, "template_mined": "<NUM>:<NUM> connect to <IP>"}
> {"cluster_id": "A0002", "cluster_count": 2, "template_mined": "<NUM>:<NUM> Hex number <HEX>"}
> {"cluster_id": "A0003", "cluster_count": 3, "template_mined": "<NUM>:<NUM> executed cmd <CMD>"}
```

This code is upgrade of original Drain code from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6 or later with fixes of some bugs and additional features:

>Note: *Original code can be found here: [https://github.com/logpai/logparser/blob/master/logparser/Drain](https://github.com/logpai/logparser/blob/master/logparser/Drain)*



### The main new features in this repository are:
- **persistence** - save drain state to Kafka or file
- **masking** - mask classified information so it will be hide in the template (for example: IP address)

### The input for Drain3 are **raw log** entries and the output is JSON with the following fields:
- `cluster_id`: id of the cluster that the raw_log belong to, for example, A0008
- `cluster_count`: total clusters instances count seen till now
- `template_mined`: the last template of above cluster_id

- templates are changed over time based on input, for example:

> input: aa aa aa
>
> output: @@{"cluster_id": "A0012", "cluster_count": 12, "template_mined": "aa aa aa"}
>
> input: aa aa ab
>
> output: Â @@{"cluster_id":"A0012", "cluster_count": 12, "template_mined": "aa aa <\*>"}


**Explanation:** *Drain3 learned that the third token is a parameter*

## Configuration

Drain3 is configured using [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/configparser.html) using file `drain3.ini` available parameters are:
- `[DEFAULT]/snapshot_poll_timeout_sec` - maximum timeout for restoring snapshot from Kafka (default 60)
- `[DEFAULT]/sim_th` - recognition threshold (default 0.4)
- `[DEFAULT]/masking` - parameters masking - in json format (default "")
- `[DEFAULT]/print_prefix` - prefix added to examples print commands (default "@@")
- `[DEFAULT]/snapshot_interval_minutes` - interval for new snapshots (default 1)

## Masking

This feature allows masking of specific parameters in the template to specific keywords. Use List of regular expression  
dictionaries in the configuration file with the format {'regex_pattern', 'mask_with'} to set custom masking

In order to mask IP address created the file `drain3.ini` :

```
[DEFAULT]
masking = [
    {"regex_pattern":"((?<=[^A-Za-z0-9])|^)(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3})((?=[^A-Za-z0-9])|$)", "mask_with": "IP"},
    ]
```

Now, Drain3 recognizes IP addresses in templates, for example with input such as:
>  `IP is 12.12.12.12`
Drain3 output output:
> `{"cluster_id": "A0015", "cluster_count": 16, "template_mined": "my ip is <IP>"}`

Note: template parameters that do not match custom masking are output as <*>

## Persistent:
The persistent feature saves and loads a snapshot of drain3 state in json format. This feature adds restart resiliency
to drain allowing continuation of activity and knowledge cross restarts.

Drain3 state includes all the templates and clusters_id that were identified up until snapshot time.

The snapshot also persist number of occurrences per cluster, and the cluster_id.

An example of a snapshot:
```
{"clusters": [{"cluster_id": "A0001", "log_template_tokens": `["aa", "aa", "<\*>"]`, "py/object": "drain3_core.LogCluster", "size": 2}, {"cluster_id": "A0002", "log_template_tokens": `["My", "IP", "is", "<IP>"]`, "py/object": "drain3_core.LogCluster", "size": 1}]...
```

This example snapshot persist two clusters_id with the templates:

> `["aa", "aa", "<\*>"]` - occurs twice
>
>  `["My", "IP", "is", "<IP>"]` - occurs once

Snapshots are created in the following events:

- new_template - in any new template
- update_template - in any update of a template
- periodic - after X ("snapshot_interval_minutes") from teh last snapshot (this parameter is in the app_cong.py)


Drain3 supports two persistence methods:

- **Kafka** - The snapshot is saved in a topic used only for snapshots - the last message in this topic is the last snapshot that will be uploaded after restart.
For Kafka persistence, you need to provide: `topic_name` and `server_name`. see Kafka_persist example below

- **File** - The snapshot is saved in a file that restores only last message, (during the persistent it creates a tmp file in the path directory)
For File persistence, you need to provide: `file_name`, `path_name`. see File_persist example below

## Installation

drain3 is available from pypi. To install use `pip`:

```pip3 install drain3```


## Examples

### Example File_persist

Uses Drain from stdin/out and persist to a snapshot to file.

To experience with the example execute :

```
python examples/example_drain_online_with_file_persist.py
```

now enter several log lines using the command line. For example enter:

```
10:00 test1
10:10 test2
10:20 test2
10:30 test3
10:40 test1
```

stop execution (using ^c) 
Use `cat snapshot.txt` to explore drain snapshot file that was created.

### example KAFKA_persist

Uses Drain from stdin/out and persist to kafka.

To experience with the example execute :

```
python examples/example_drain_online_with_kafka_persist.py
```

follow same usage as in File_persist example

Use kafka tools to explore the snapshot in the topic `topic_demo_tenant_id`

### example masking

To experience with the example execute :
(Note: *an example drain3.ini file exists in the `examples` folder*)

```
cd examples
python example_drain_online_with_file_persist.py
```

now enter several log lines using the command line. For example enter:

```
10:00 connect to 10.0.0.1
10:10 connect to 10.0.0.2
10:20 connect to 10.0.0.3
10:30 Hex number 0xDEADBEAF
10:30 Hex number 0x10000
10:40 executed cmd "print"
10:50 executed cmd "sleep"

```
