.. _versions_json_structure:

===========================
``versions.json`` structure
===========================

The internal structure of the ``versions.json`` file generated by the
``doctr-versions-menu`` command is important for the
:ref:`sphinx_ext_customization` of the ``doctr-versions-menu.js_t`` template,
and for :ref:`customizing_index_html`.

The file contains a (nested) dictionary with the following keys:

* 'downloads': a map from folder names to a list of tuples (text, url) for download items for that folder
* 'folders': a list of all known folders
* 'labels': a map from folder names to the label for each folder in the versions menu
* 'latest_release': the latest stable release, or none
* 'versions': the list of folders in the (reverse) order in which they should appear in the versions menu
* 'warnings': a map from folder names to a list of warning labels for the warnings that should be displayed for that folder
