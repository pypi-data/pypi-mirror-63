     True
        association end is navigable
     False
        association end is not navigable
     None
        association end navigability is unkown

    There are two ways of specifing that an end is navigable

    - an end is in Association.navigableOwnedEnd collection
    - an end is class (interface) attribute (stored in Class.ownedAttribute
      collection)

    Let's consider the graph::

        A -----> B
          y    x

    There two association ends A.x and B.y, A.x is navigable.

    Therefore navigable association ends are constructed in following way

    - if A is a class or an interface, then A.x is an attribute owned by A
    - if A is other classifier, then association is more general
      relationship; it may mean that participating instance of B can be
      "accessed efficiently"
      - i.e. when A is a Component, then association may be some compositing
        relationship
      - when A and B are instances of Node class, then it is a
        communication path

    Therefore navigable association end may be stored as one of
    - {Class,Interface}.ownedAttribute due to their capabilities of
      editing owned members
    - Association.navigableOwnedEnd

    When an end has unknown (unspecified) navigability, then it is owned by
    association (but not by classifier).

    When an end is non-navigable, then it is just member of an association.
