DeCiDa is a Python Library of functions and classes for
device characterization, circuit design and data analysis.

DeCida is written in pure Python (2.7, and 3), and requires no code-compilation.
It is portable to any operating system where Python is installed, and runs
under MacOS, Windows, Cygwin, and Linux.  Many DeCiDa classes and functions
require the numpy and Tkinter packages.

This version of DeCiDa provides support for Python 3 and can be run under
a Python 3 environment, as well as a Python 2.7 environment.
The following packages are now required: future, six, numpy and matplotlib.
Please let me know if there are any issues that you find.

Two methods are added to the Data class to interface easily with
numpy and pandas.  The tests test_Data_read_pandas, test_Data_read_numpy_arrays,
and test_Data_read_handoff_pandas show how to interchange data.

Data row iteration is also added.  The test test_Data_iter shows how to use
row iteration.

DeCiDa uses matplotlib XY-plot rendering by default.
To use the former XY-plot rendering, add the option -xmat
to dataview, plotter, pllss, and pll_phase_noise.

For circuit analysis, DeCiDa provides a flexible scripting class for
performing simulations with various circuit simulation tools, such as
(Synopsys) HSpice, (Cadence) Spectre, (Silvaco) SmartSpice,
(UC Berkeley) NGspice and others.
The Tckt class is used to provide a database of process corners for
each project, and to provide netlist templating for performing procedural
simulations and post-processing.
Scripts using Tckt access the database to obtain
the corner conditions, modify the netlist, and allow full Python looping
structures for running the simulation, viewing and analyzing
the simulated data.

For data analysis, DeCiDa provides a Data class for reading-in and 
analyzing data in a number of formats, including nutmeg
(NGspice, Spectre, LTspice), CSDF (HSpice), CSV (comma-separated value),
SSV (space-separated value), and others.
The Data object can be viewed using the XYplotm, Histogramx or DataViewm
classes.
DataViewm has commands via menu entries to manipulate and plot the data in
different ways, including frequency versus time, eye- and scope-diagrams
and column calculations.

DeCiDa started out as a Tcl/Tk application for analyzing measurements
of electron devices for performing routine compact-model parameter extraction.
To do this fitting, a least-squares optimization algorithm was used.
This Python version of DeCiDa has a function LevMar (for Levenberg-Marquardt),
based on the mpfit package.  It is still under development.

**Installing DeCiDa**
=====================

If you have pip
---------------

* issue this command::

    pip install DeCiDa

Note that the scripts that should be installed in
the python bin directory (dataview, plotter, ...) may not arrive there.
And the home directory directories may not get set up properly.  If this
happens, simply download the distribution and copy these from the untarred
folders.

Otherwise
---------

Download and prepare the distribution
-------------------------------------

* unzip/untar the distribution::

    tar xvfz DeCiDa.1.1.5-tar.gz

* cd into the distribution directory::

    cd DeCiDa-1.1.5

* you may want to install the DeCiDa html documentation (in ./doc/html)
  to an appropriate place for future reference.
  use a browser to read the documentation, using the url file:// specification
  to point to the index.html file in the html directory.

* manually modify the wrapper scripts in the distribution
  ./etc/wrapper directory (run_*), to point to correct tool locations.
  
  The wrappers have the following references to other tools.  
  Adjust these as needed, as required by your local environment.

+----------------+-------------------------------+
| wrapper:       | expected tool location:       |
+================+===============================+
| run_hspice     | /tools/hspice/bin/hspice      |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| run_ngspice    | /opt/local/bin/ngspice        |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| run_sspice     | /tools/silvaco/bin/sspice     |
+----------------+-------------------------------+
| run_spectre    | /tools/cds/bin/spectre        |
+----------------+-------------------------------+

Installing under Anaconda
-------------------------

    refer to: `Managing packages <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html>`_

* DeCiDa is not yet a conda-installable package

* be sure that Anaconda python is in your path::

    python
    >>> import sys; sys.prefix

  you should see a path like the following::

    /Users/<user>/anaconda (MacOs)

    /home/<user>/anaconda (Linux)

* install the distribution::

    python setup.py install

* you will find a new directory .DeCiDa in your home directory containing
  various tool specific scripts, models and other data

* the DeCiDa libraries are installed under site-packages

  If decida is installed as a compressed file (egg file), the test directory
  test files are not available to test, so some tests will not work.  Use the
  tests in the unzipped decida/test directory instead

* the DeCiDa applications are installed in the python bin directory
  so they should be in the user path (may require a shell rehash)

Installing under Enthought Canopy
---------------------------------

* install in the Canopy Python User Virtual Environment

    refer to: `Installing packages into Canopy <https://support.enthought.com/entries/23389761-Installing-packages-into-Canopy-User-Python-from-the-command-line/>`_, `Canopy python default <https://support.enthought.com/entries/23646538-Make-Canopy-s-Python-be-your-default-Python-i-e-on-the-PATH->`_

* be sure that User python is in your path::

    python
    >>> import sys; sys.prefix

  you should see a path like one of the following::

    /Users/<user>/Library/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User (MacOs)

    /home/<user>/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User (Linux)


* install the distribution::

    python setup.py install

* you will find a new directory .DeCiDa in your home directory containing
  various tool specific scripts, models and other data

* the DeCiDa libraries are installed under site-packages

  If decida is installed as a compressed file (egg file), the test directory
  test files are not available to test, so some tests will not work.  Use the
  tests in the unzipped decida/test directory instead

* the DeCiDa applications are installed in the python bin directory
  so they should be in the user path (may require a shell rehash)

Installing under (2.7) python
-----------------------------

* be sure that python2.7 is in your path::

    python
    >>> import sys; sys.prefix

  you should see a path like one of the following::

    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7 (MacOS)

    /opt/local/lib/python2.7 (Linux)

* install the distribution::

    python setup.py install

Installing as a local library
-----------------------------

* DeCiDa can also be installed in a user's directory without requiring sysadmin
  privileges.

* select or make a directory for putting python libraries::

    mkdir ~/python/library

* copy the decida library to the python library in your home directory::

    cp -R ./decida ~/python/library

* edit the python resource file in ./etc/dot (.pythonrc.py).
  change the pylib definition appropriately to point to ~/python/library

* copy the resource file to your home directory::

    cp ./etc/dot/.pythonrc.py ~/.

* to use decida, import the user package, which imports ~/.pythonrc.py::

    >>> import user

    This is not available under python3, so use the following alternative.

* alternatively, define the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include
  ~/python/library in the path

* copy the applications to the user home bin directory::

    cp ./bin/* ~/bin

* make a .DeCiDa home directory, and populate it with the files from etc

    mkdir ~/.DeCiDa

    cp -R etc/* ~/.DeCiDa/.

Test the distribution using the distribution tests
--------------------------------------------------

* test the distribution with one or more individual tests::

    python
    >>> import decida.test.test_Calc_1

  should display a calculator

    >>> import decida.test.test_Plotterm

  should display a plot and equation-set text-window

* list all of the tests::

     python
     >>> import decida.test
     >>> decida.test.test_list()

  should print all of the tests

* do all of the tests::

     python
     >>> import decida.test.test_all

  this may or may not complete depending on the sequence of closing windows

* the tests can also be run directly in the unzipped/tarred (pre-install) directory::

     cd DeCiDa-1.1.5/decida/test
     test_DataViewm_4.py

* test the applications installed in the python bin::

     twin

  should display a text-window (text-editor)
