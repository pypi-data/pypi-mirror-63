Description: # Keep-Sabbath
        
        Django app to automatically redirect users when it is the Sabbath day, with support for overriding on other Biblical Holy days.
        
        For webmasters with e-commerce shops, etc. who would like to keep the Sabbath day holy. This app allows you to easily setup a system that will automatically* redirect visitors to a single page (explaining about the sabbath, redirect, etc.) if it is the Sabbath day. The app uses an API and the date and time of the server to figure out if it is the Sabbath, so you do not have to do it manually. However, there is an option to override it as well.
