Description: 
        Python wrapper for the GnuTLS library
        
        This package provides a high level object oriented wrapper around libgnutls,
        as well as low level bindings to the GnuTLS types and functions via ctypes.
        The high level wrapper hides the details of accessing the GnuTLS library via
        ctypes behind a set of classes that encapsulate GnuTLS sessions, certificates
        and credentials and expose them to python applications using a simple API.
        
        The package also includes a Twisted interface that has seamless intergration
        with Twisted, providing connectTLS and listenTLS methods on the Twisted
        reactor once imported (the methods are automatically attached to the reactor
        by simply importing the GnuTLS Twisted interface module).
        
        The high level wrapper is written using the GnuTLS library bindings that are
        made available via ctypes. This makes the wrapper very powerful and flexible
        as it has direct access to all the GnuTLS internals and is also very easy to
        extend without any need to write C code or recompile anything.
