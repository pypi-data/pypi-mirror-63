        # Install
        
        ## On Debian testing
        
        On Debian, pyspread is available as a package.
        A Python3 version is only available in testing at the moment.
        
        ```bash
        su -
        apt install pyspread
        ```
        
        ## Other platforms
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Get the prerequisites:
        - Python (>=3.6)
        - PyQt5 (>=5.10) (must include PyQtSvg)
        - numpy (>=1.1)
        
        and if needed the suggested modules:
        - matplotlib (>=1.1.1)
        - pyenchant (>=1.1)
        - pip (>=18)
        
        Should the package pkg_resources be missing in your setup (e.g. on Ubuntu),
        then you may need to reinstall pip for Python3.
        
        #### On Debian unstable:
        
        ```bash
        su -
        apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtsvg python3-numpy python3-pyqt5.qtwebengine
        apt install python3-matplotlib python3-enchant python3-pip
        ```
        
        #### With pip
        
        The example installs the dependencies for the current user. Make sure that
        you are using the Python3 version of pip.
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install --user requirements.txt
        ```
