# Pangsit (py)

Pangsit (py) is my starter pack framework represented in Python to deal with learning computing such as Machine/Deep Learning,

> I'll create a documentation for this later.

```shell script
pip3 install pangsitpy

This package updates frequently, so make sure you're using the latest version
