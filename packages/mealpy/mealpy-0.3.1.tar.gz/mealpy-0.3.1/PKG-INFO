        ### Documents
        * Levy: Using levy-flight technique or not
        * Version: 
            + original: Taken exactly from the paper
            + changed: I changed the flow or equation to make algorithm works
        * Type:
            + weak: working fine with uni-modal and some multi-modal functions
            + strong: working good with uni-modal, multi-modal, some hybrid and some composite functions
            + best: working well with almost all kind of functions
        
        * Some algorithm with original version and no levy techniques still belong to the best type such as:
            + Whale Optimization Algorithm
            + Bird Swarm Algorithm
            + Swarm Robotics Search And Rescue
            + Manta Ray Foraging Optimization
            + Henry Gas Solubility Optimization	
            + Atom Search Optimization
            + Equilibrium Optimizer
