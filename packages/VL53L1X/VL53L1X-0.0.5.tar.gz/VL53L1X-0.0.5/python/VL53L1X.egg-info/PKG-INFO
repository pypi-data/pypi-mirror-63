        # Installing
        
        ```
        sudo pip install smbus2
        sudo pip install vl53l1x
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        ```python
        import VL53L1X
        
        # Open and start the VL53L1X sensor.
        # If you've previously used change-address.py then you
        # should use the new i2c address here.
        # If you're using a software i2c bus (ie: HyperPixel4) then
        # you should `ls /dev/i2c-*` and use the relevant bus number.
        tof = VL53L1X.VL53L1X(i2c_bus=1, i2c_address=0x29)
        tof.open()
        
        # Optionally set an explicit timing budget
        # These values are measurement time in microseconds,
        # and inter-measurement time in milliseconds.
        # If you uncomment the line below to set a budget you
        # should use `tof.start_ranging(0)`
        # tof.set_timing(66000, 70)
        
        tof.start_ranging(1)  # Start ranging
                              # 0 = Unchanged
                              # 1 = Short Range
                              # 2 = Medium Range
                              # 3 = Long Range
        
        # Grab the range in mm, this function will block until
        # a reading is returned.
        distance_in_mm = tof.get_distance()
        
        tof.stop_ranging()
        ```
