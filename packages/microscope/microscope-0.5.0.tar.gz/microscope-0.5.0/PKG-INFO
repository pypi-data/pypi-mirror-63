Description: Python's microscope package is a free and open source framework for:
        
        * control of local and remote microscope devices
        * aggregation of microscope devices into complex microscopes
        * automate microscope experiments
        
        It is aimed at those that are building their own microscopes or need
        programmatic control for microscope experiments.
        
        This package does *not* provide a graphical user interface that a
        typical microscope user would expect.  Instead, it provides the
        foundation over which such interfaces can be built.  For a microscope
        graphical user interface, consider the sister project `microscope
        cockpit <https://github.com/MicronOxford/cockpit>`_.
        
        Microscope is distributed as a source distribution in `PyPI
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/microscope>`_ and can be easily
        installed with `pip`::
        
            pip install microscope
        
        Alternatively, the development sources are also available on `github
        <https://github.com/MicronOxford/microscope.git>`_.
