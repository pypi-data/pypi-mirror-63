Mastodon.py
===========
.. py:module:: mastodon
.. py:class: Mastodon
   
Register your app! This only needs to be done once. Uncomment the code and substitute in your information:

.. code-block:: python

   from mastodon import Mastodon

   '''
   Mastodon.create_app(
        'pytooterapp',
        api_base_url = 'https://mastodon.social',
        to_file = 'pytooter_clientcred.secret'
   )
   '''

Then login. This can be done every time, or you can use the persisted information:

.. code-block:: python

   from mastodon import Mastodon
   
   mastodon = Mastodon(
       client_id = 'pytooter_clientcred.secret',
       api_base_url = 'https://mastodon.social'
   )
   mastodon.log_in(
       'my_login_email@example.com',
       'incrediblygoodpassword',
       to_file = 'pytooter_usercred.secret'
   )

To post, create an actual API instance:

.. code-block:: python

   from mastodon import Mastodon
   
   mastodon = Mastodon(
       access_token = 'pytooter_usercred.secret',
       api_base_url = 'https://mastodon.social'
   )
   mastodon.toot('Tooting from python using #mastodonpy !')   

`Mastodon`_ is an ActivityPub and OStatus based twitter-like federated social 
network node. It has an API that allows you to interact with its 
every aspect. This is a simple python wrapper for that api, provided
as a single python module. By default, it talks to the 
`Mastodon flagship instance`_, but it can be set to talk to any 
node running Mastodon by setting `api_base_url` when creating the
api object (or creating an app).

Mastodon.py aims to implement the complete public Mastodon API. As
of this time, it is feature complete for Mastodon version 3.0.1. Pleromas
Mastodon API layer, while not an official target, should also be basically
compatible, and Mastodon.py does make some allowances for behaviour that isn't
strictly like Mastodons.

A note about rate limits
------------------------
Mastodons API rate limits per user account. By default, the limit is 300 requests 
per 5 minute time slot. This can differ from instance to instance and is subject to change.
Mastodon.py has three modes for dealing with rate limiting that you can pass to 
the constructor, "throw", "wait" and "pace", "wait" being the default.

In "throw" mode, Mastodon.py makes no attempt to stick to rate limits. When
a request hits the rate limit, it simply throws a `MastodonRateLimitError`. This is
for applications that need to handle all rate limiting themselves (i.e. interactive apps), 
or applications wanting to use Mastodon.py in a multi-threaded context ("wait" and "pace" 
modes are not thread safe).

.. note::
   Rate limit information is available on the `Mastodon` object for applications that
   implement their own rate limit handling.

   .. attribute:: Mastodon.ratelimit_remaining

      Number of requests allowed until the next reset.

   .. attribute:: Mastodon.ratelimit_reset

      Time at which the rate limit will next be reset, as a POSIX timestamp.

   .. attribute:: Mastodon.ratelimit_limit

      Total number of requests allowed between resets. Typically 300.

   .. attribute:: Mastodon.ratelimit_lastcall

      Time at which these values have last been seen and updated, as a POSIX timestamp.

In "wait" mode, once a request hits the rate limit, Mastodon.py will wait until
the rate limit resets and then try again, until the request succeeds or an error
is encountered. This mode is for applications that would rather just not worry about rate limits
much, don't poll the api all that often, and are okay with a call sometimes just taking
a while.

In "pace" mode, Mastodon.py will delay each new request after the first one such that, 
if requests were to continue at the same rate, only a certain fraction (set in the
constructor as `ratelimit_pacefactor`) of the rate limit will be used up. The fraction can
be (and by default, is) greater than one. If the rate limit is hit, "pace" behaves like
"wait". This mode is probably the most advanced one and allows you to just poll in
a loop without ever sleeping at all yourself. It is for applications that would rather
just pretend there is no such thing as a rate limit and are fine with sometimes not
being very interactive.

In addition to the per-user limit, there is a per-IP limit of 7500 requests per 5 
minute time slot, and tighter limits on logins. Mastodon.py does not make any effort
to respect these.

If your application requires many hits to endpoints that are available without logging
in, do consider using Mastodon.py without authenticating to get the full per-IP limit.


A note about pagination
-----------------------
Many of Mastodons API endpoints are paginated. What this means is that if you request
data from them, you might not get all the data at once - instead, you might only get the
first few results.

All endpoints that are paginated have four parameters: since_id, max_id, min_id and 
limit. since_id allows you to specify the smallest id you want in the returned data, but
you will still always get the newest data, so if there are too many statuses between
the newest one and since_id, some will not be returned. min_id, on the other hand, gives
you statuses with that minimum id and newer, starting at the given id. max_id, similarly, 
allows you to specify the largest id you want. By specifying either min_id or max_id 
(generally, only one, not both) of them you can go through pages forwards and backwards.

limit allows you to specify how many results you would like returned. Note that an
instance may choose to return less results than you requested - by default, Mastodon 
will return no more than 40 statues and no more than 80 accounts no matter how high
you set the limit.

The responses returned by paginated endpoints contain a "link" header that specifies
which parameters to use to get the next and previous pages. Mastodon.py parses these
and stores them (if present) in the first (for the previous page) and last (for the 
next page) item of the returned list as _pagination_prev and _pagination_next. They
are accessible only via attribute-style access. Note that this means that if you 
want to persist pagination info with your data, you'll have to take care of that
manually (or persist objects, not just dicts).

There are convenience functions available for fetching the previous and next page of
a paginated request as well as for fetching all pages starting from a first page.

Two notes about IDs
-------------------
Mastodons API uses IDs in several places: User IDs, Toot IDs, ...

While debugging, it might be tempting to copy-paste in IDs from the
web interface into your code. This will not work, as the IDs on the web
interface and in the URLs are not the same as the IDs used internally
in the API, so don't do that.

ID unpacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wherever Mastodon.py expects an ID as a parameter, you can also pass a
dict that contains an id - this means that, for example, instead of writing 

.. code-block:: python

    mastodon.status_post("@somebody wow!", in_reply_to_id = toot["id"])
    
you can also just write

.. code-block:: python

    mastodon.status_post("@somebody wow!", in_reply_to_id = toot)
    
and everything will work as intended.

Error handling
--------------
When Mastodon.py encounters an error, it will raise an exception, generally with
some text included to tell you what went wrong. 

The base class that all mastodon exceptions inherit from is `MastodonError`. 
If you are only interested in the fact an error was raised somewhere in
Mastodon.py, and not the details, this is the exception you can catch.

`MastodonIllegalArgumentError` is generally a programming problem - you asked the 
API to do something obviously invalid (i.e. specify a privacy option that does
not exist).

`MastodonFileNotFoundError` and `MastodonNetworkError` are IO errors - could be you
specified a wrong URL, could be the internet is down or your hard drive is
dying. They inherit from `MastodonIOError`, for easy catching. There is a sub-error
of `MastodonNetworkError`, `MastodonReadTimeout`, which is thrown when a streaming
API stream times out during reading.

`MastodonAPIError` is an error returned from the Mastodon instance - the server
has decided it can't fullfill your request (i.e. you requested info on a user that
does not exist). It is further split into `MastodonNotFoundError` (API returned 404)
and `MastodonUnauthorizedError` (API returned 401). Different error codes might exist,
but are not currently handled separately.

`MastodonMalformedEventError` is raised when a streaming API listener receives an
invalid event. There have been reports that this can sometimes happen after prolonged
operation due to an upstream problem in the requests/urllib libraries. 

`MastodonRatelimitError` is raised when you hit an API rate limit. You should try 
again after a while (see the rate limiting section above).

`MastodonServerError` is raised when the server throws an internal error, likely due
to server misconfiguration.

`MastodonVersionError` is raised when a version check for an API call fails.

A brief note on block lists
---------------------------
The default distribution of Mastodon.py prevents you from logging in to instances on a very short list of domains. The purpose of this is to disassociate the developers of Mastodon.py from these instances and to disavow the ideology of violence that they represent. You could, of course, take that part out - Mastodon.py is free software, and you have the right to modify it to suit your needs.

While you take the extra step of removing the code, please take a moment to consider why reasonable people whose work you build and depend on every day thought it was necessary to put it in to begin with.

Return values
-------------
Unless otherwise specified, all data is returned as python dictionaries, matching 
the JSON format used by the API. Dates returned by the API are in ISO 8601 format
and are parsed into python datetime objects.

To make access easier, the dictionaries returned are wrapped by a class that adds
read-only attributes for all dict values - this means that, for example, instead of
writing

.. code-block:: python

    description = mastodon.account_verify_credentials()["source"]["note"]
    
you can also just write

.. code-block:: python

    description = mastodon.account_verify_credentials().source.note
    
and everything will work as intended. The class used for this is exposed as
`AttribAccessDict`.

App registration and user authentication
----------------------------------------
Before you can use the mastodon API, you have to register your 
application (which gets you a client key and client secret) 
and then log in (which gets you an access token). These functions 
allow you to do those things. Additionally, it is also possible
to programmatically register a new user.

For convenience, once you have a client id, secret and access token, 
you can simply pass them to the constructor of the class, too!

Note that while it is perfectly reasonable to log back in whenever 
your app starts, registering a new application on every 
startup is not, so don't do that - instead, register an application 
once, and then persist your client id and secret. A convenient method
for this is provided by the functions dealing with registering the app,
logging in and the Mastodon classes constructor.

To talk to an instance different from the flagship instance, specify
the api_base_url (usually, just the URL of the instance, i.e. 
https://mastodon.social/ for the flagship instance). If no protocol
is specified, Mastodon.py defaults to https.

.. automethod:: Mastodon.create_app
.. automethod:: Mastodon.__init__
.. _log_in():
.. automethod:: Mastodon.log_in
.. _auth_request_url():
.. automethod:: Mastodon.auth_request_url
.. automethod:: Mastodon.create_account

Versioning
----------
Mastodon.py will check if a certain endpoint is available before doing API
calls. By default, it checks against the version of Mastodon retrieved on
init(), or the version you specified. Mastodon.py can be set (in the 
constructor) to either check if an endpoint is available at all (this is the 
default) or to check if the endpoint is available and behaves as in the newest 
Mastodon version (with regards to parameters as well as return values). 
Version checking can also be disabled altogether. If a version check fails, 
Mastodon.py throws a `MastodonVersionError`.

With the following functions, you can make Mastodon.py re-check the server 
version or explicitly determine if a specific minimum Version is available.
Long-running applications that aim to support multiple Mastodon versions
should do this from time to time in case a server they are running against 
updated.

This requires Mastodon.pys optional "blurhash" feature dependencies.

.. automethod:: Mastodon.decode_blurhash

Streaming
---------
These functions allow access to the streaming API. For the public, local and hashtag streams,
access is generally possible without authenticating.

If `async` is False, these  methods block forever (or until an error is encountered).

If `async` is True, the listener will listen on another thread and these methods
will return a handle corresponding to the open connection. If, in addition, `async_reconnect` is True,
the thread will attempt to reconnect to the streaming API if any errors are encountered, waiting
`async_reconnect_wait_sec` seconds between reconnection attempts. Note that no effort is made
to "catch up" - events created while the connection is broken will not be received. If you need to make
sure to get absolutely all notifications / deletes / toots, you will have to do that manually, e.g.
using the `on_abort` handler to fill in events since the last received one and then reconnecting.

The connection may be closed at any time by calling the handles close() method. The 
current status of the handler thread can be checked with the handles is_alive() function,
and the streaming status can be checked by calling is_receiving().

The streaming functions take instances of `StreamListener` as the `listener` parameter.
A `CallbackStreamListener` class that allows you to specify function callbacks 
directly is included for convenience.

When in not-async mode or async mode without async_reconnect, the stream functions may raise
various exceptions: `MastodonMalformedEventError` if a received event cannot be parsed and
`MastodonNetworkError` if any connection problems occur.

.. automethod:: Mastodon.stream_user
.. automethod:: Mastodon.stream_public
.. automethod:: Mastodon.stream_local

.. automethod:: StreamListener.on_abort
.. automethod:: StreamListener.handle_heartbeat

CallbackStreamListener
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: CallbackStreamListener

Push subscriptions
------------------
These functions allow you to manage webpush subscriptions and to decrypt received
pushes. Note that the intended setup is not mastodon pushing directly to a users client - 
the push endpoint should usually be a relay server that then takes care of delivering the 
(encrypted) push to the end user via some mechanism, where it can then be decrypted and
displayed.

Mastodon allows an application to have one webpush subscription per user at a time.

All crypto utilities require Mastodon.pys optional "webpush" feature dependencies
(specifically, the "cryptography" and "http_ece" packages).

.. automethod:: Mastodon.push_subscription
.. automethod:: Mastodon.push_subscription_set
.. automethod:: Mastodon.push_subscription_update

.. _push_subscription_generate_keys():

.. automethod:: Mastodon.push_subscription_generate_keys
.. automethod:: Mastodon.push_subscription_decrypt_push


Moderation API
--------------
These functions allow you to perform moderation actions on users and generally
process reports using the API. To do this, you need access to the "admin:read" and/or
"admin:write" scopes or their more granular variants (both for the application and the 
access token), as well as at least moderator access. Mastodon.py will not request these 
by default, as that would be very dangerous.

BIG WARNING: TREAT ANY ACCESS TOKENS THAT HAVE ADMIN CREDENTIALS AS EXTREMELY, MASSIVELY
SENSITIVE DATA AND MAKE EXTRA SURE TO REVOKE THEM AFTER TESTING, NOT LET THEM SIT IN FILES
SOMEWHERE, TRACK WHICH ARE ACTIVE, ET CETERA. ANY EXPOSURE OF SUCH ACCESS TOKENS MEANS YOU
EXPOSE THE PERSONAL DATA OF ALL YOUR USERS TO WHOEVER HAS THESE TOKENS. TREAT THEM WITH
EXTREME CARE.

This is not to say that you should not treat access tokens from admin accounts that do not
have admin: scopes attached with a lot of care, but be extra careful with those that do.
