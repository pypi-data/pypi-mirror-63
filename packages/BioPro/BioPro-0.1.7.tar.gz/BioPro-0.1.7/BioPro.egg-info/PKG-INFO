Description: # Predicting Biochemical Pathways Involving Target RBP
        
        BioPro is a bioinformatics pipeline that processes and analyzes eCLIP data of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) to predict the functional targets of RBP and biological processes to which the functional targets of RBP contributes.
        
        BioPro pipeline cleans raw eCLIP data of a target RBP with Cutadapt and aligns the RNA sequence with STAR. Peak calling is then performed with PureCLIP. Then, based on the peaks, PRAS predicts the functional target genes of RBP and produces a ranked gene list. The pipeline then performs gene ontology (GO) analysis on the top percent ranked genes to predict the biological processes.
