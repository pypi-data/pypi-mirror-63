bandit-aws
==========

This is a `Bandit <https://pypi.org/project/bandit/>`_ plugin to scan for
strings in your source code that look like AWS keys.

Usage
-----

Bandit plugins are automatically activated once they are installed. To use this
plugin, you simply need to install the plugin::

    $ pip install bandit-aws

To verify the installation, display the bandit help text::

    $ bandit --help

It will display a list of tests that were discovered and loaded. Verify that
you see "C100 - hardcoded_aws_key" in the list.

You can then run bandit in the normal way. For example::

    $ bandit -r myproject/

If any strings that look like AWS keys are found, they will be reported::

    >> Issue: [C100:hardcoded_aws_key] Possible hardcoded AWS secret access key: 'JalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYzEXAMPLEKEY'
       Severity: Medium   Confidence: Medium
