    ----------
    decParams : float
        Exposure in seconds.
    minSize : int
        Minimum allowable window size
    minOlap : int
        Minimum allowable overlap
    windowFactor : float
        Window size calculated by sampling frequency / windowFactor to ensure good frequency domain resolution
    overlapFraction : float
        Overlap size as a fraction of window size
    windows : List[int], np.ndarray
        List or array with window sizes for each decimation level

        List or array with overlap sizes for each decimation level

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(decParams)
        Initialise with information about the decimation parameters
    getWindowSize(iDec)
        Returns window size for decimation level iDec (starts at 0)
    getOverlap(iDec)
        Returns overlap size for decimation level iDec (starts at 0)
    setWindowParameters(windowSizes, windowOverlaps)
        Directly set window sizes and overlaps
    setMinParams(minSize, minOverlap)
        Set minimum allowable window size and overlap which will be honoured when window sizes by decimation level are automatically calculated
