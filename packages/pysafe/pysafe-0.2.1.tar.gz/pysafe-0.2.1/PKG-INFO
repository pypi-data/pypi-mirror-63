        ``import pysafe``
        
        ### General usage:
        * Generate a new encryption key:
        You only need to do this once. Save your encryption key somewhere safe as
         this will be used as your master password.
         
         Note: Encrypted credentials are linked to the generated encryption key
         . Avoid generating a new key with existing login credentials as this would
          result in
          losing the ability to decrypt your saved login credentials.
        * Use previous encryption key:
        Here you can use previously generated encryption key. The encryption key is 44
         character. 
        * Save a new login:
        After saving your encryption key, you can enter as many login entries as you so
         desire
         with the ability to generate new passwords along the way, or just enter a
          password of your
          choosing. Then the program will save it for you in CSV file. The passwords
           in that CSV file will be encrypted, and can only be seen using the generated
            encryption key that we mentioned earlier.
            
        *  Show saved logins:
        The program will print out the saved logins using the saved encryption key
         and saved CSV file, so you can see them in plain text that you can use.
         
        * Generate a new password:
        This will give your the ability to generate a new password without having an
         encryption key or entering any additional information such as a website tile
          or website link. You only need to enter the length of the password and the
           program will do the rest.
        * Show locations of saved files:
        This will show you the absolute path of the generated files by the program
        * Delete all data:
        This will be used in case you wish to have a fresh start without any
         encryption key nor login credentials file file.
        
        Note: This will permanently delete your encryption key and saved login
         credentials. So only do that, if you know what you are doing.
