Description: # `coinespy` library
        
        The `coinespy` library allows users to access Bosch Sensortec's MEMS sensors on the Application Board 2.0 through a Python interface. It offers a flexible solution for developing a host independent wrapper interface for the sensors with robust error handling mechanism. The core functionalities remain the same as with usage of coinesAPI on C level.
        
        This folder contains the Python wrapper on top of the COINES C library.
