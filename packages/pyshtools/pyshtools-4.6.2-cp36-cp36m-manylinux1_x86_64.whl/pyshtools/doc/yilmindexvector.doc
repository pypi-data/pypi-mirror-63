Compute the index of an 1D array of spherical harmonic coefficients
corresponding to i, l, and m.

Usage
-----
index = YilmIndexVector (i, l, m)

Returns
-------
index : integer
    Index of an 1D array of spherical harmonic coefficients corresponding to i,
    l, and m.

Parameters
----------
i : integer
    1 corresponds to the cosine coefficient cilm[0,:,:], and 2 corresponds to
    the sine coefficient cilm[1,:,:].
l : integer
    The spherical harmonic degree.
m : integer
    The angular order.

Description
-----------
YilmIndexVector will calculate the index of a 1D vector of spherical harmonic
coefficients corresponding to degree l, angular order m and i (1 = cosine, 2 =
sine). The elements of the 1D vector array are packed by successive degrees,
where each degree lists the l+1 cosine terms and then the l cosine terms. The
index is given explicitly by l**2+(i-1)*l+m.
