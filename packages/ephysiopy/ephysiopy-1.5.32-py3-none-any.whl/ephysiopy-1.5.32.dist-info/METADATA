## Synopsis

Tools for the analysis of electrophysiological data collected with the Axona or openephys recording systems.

## Installation

ephysiopy requires python3.6 or greater. The easiest way to install is using pip:

> python3 -m pip install dacq2py

Or similar.

This will install all the pre-requisites, which are as follows:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* scikits-learn
* [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) (for NaN-friendly convolution)
* skimage
* [mahotas](http://mahotas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* h5py

I haven't yet tried this in a conda like environment but a quick google shows it should be pretty easy.

## Code Example

Main entry class is Trial contained in dacq2py_util i.e.

```
import dacq2py_util
T = dacq2py_util.Trial('/path/to/dataset/mytrial')
```

The "usual" Axona dataset includes the following files:

* mytrial.set
* mytrial.1
* mytrial.2
* mytrial.3
* mytrial.4
* mytrial.pos
* mytrial.eeg

Note that you shouldn't specify a suffix when constructing the filename in the code example above.

You can now start analysing your data! i.e.

```
T.plotEEGPower()
T.plotMap(tetrode=1, cluster=4)
```

## Motivation

Analysis using Axona's Tint cluster cutting program or phy/ phy2 (openephys) is great but limited. This extends that functionality.

Optional packages include:

* [klustakwik](https://github.com/klusta-team/klustakwik)

Download the files and extract to a folder and make sure it's on your Python path
