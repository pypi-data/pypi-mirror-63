===========================
redturtle.tiles.tileoftiles
===========================

Tile that renders a tile manager.
The rendered tile manager is the one from ``redturtle.tiles.management``, so this add-on only works with that manager, and does not work with Mosaic.
This tile allows for more complicated layout using a rather simple tile manager.

Install redturtle.tiles.tileoftiles by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]
