The software should be usable by reading the docstrings. If you think that
certain features are missing or you found a bug, don't hesitate to ask me
via mail!

Supported Python versions currently are 2.7 and >= 3.5.

Installation should be easy using setup.py. I recommend running the test suite
by invoking "python test.py" from the source tree to spot problems early.
