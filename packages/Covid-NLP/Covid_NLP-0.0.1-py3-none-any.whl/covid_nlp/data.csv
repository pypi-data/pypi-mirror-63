"Response","Context"
"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.","Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.","Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell."
"Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.","Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.","The disease can spread from person to person. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person."
"WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.","The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
"Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.","The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.","The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease."
"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.","It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings."
"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.","While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating."
"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.","Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news."
"Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.","Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands."
"Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.","When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease."
"Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.","Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick."
"Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.","This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately."
"Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.","Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19."
"Stay home if you feel unwell.","If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority."
"Stay home if you feel unwell.","National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections."
"Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely).","If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease."
"Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely).","You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas."
"Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache or low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose until you recover.", "If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out e.g. to buy food then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people."
"Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover.", "Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses."
"If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition.","Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses"
"For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low","However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher."
"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. ","However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones."
"We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities.","First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections.","COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection."
"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease.","WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
"Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.","However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care."
"Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation.", "They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19."
"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically but the diseases they cause are quite different.", "No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically. but the diseases they cause are quite different."
"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.", "Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks. so WHO urges people to use masks wisely."
"The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.", "This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan. China in December 2019."
"The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.", "Wuhan is the place where coronavirus happened."
"in Wuhan, China.", "Wuhan is the place where coronavirus happened."

"in December 2019.", "Coronavirus start spreading in December 2019."
"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease.","Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.","Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed."
"To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.","Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.","Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)."
"If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others.","Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
"Bat. camel and civer cat.", "Bat is animal spreading coronavirus. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were originally bat viruses that spread to an intermediate animal (camel and civet cat). which then exposed humans to the viruses"
