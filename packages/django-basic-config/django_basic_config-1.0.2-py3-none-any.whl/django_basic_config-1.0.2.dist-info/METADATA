# django_config

<!-- TOC -->

This is a basic django app that creates a table for EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) configuration settings where each row has the following fields:

- application
- property_name
- property_value

It provides methods for retrieving configuration properties that allow for a default value to be passed in.  It is entirely in the admin and ORM layer, does not include an external-facing web app.  This is purposely not all that complicated or sophisticated.  If you want something more robust, there are other, better options.  This is quick and dirty.

# Installation

- This application, simple though it may be, has been updated to support django 1.7 and later, and with it the new built-in data migrations.

    - install django_config - Either:

                'django.contrib.contenttypes',
                'django.contrib.sessions',
                'django.contrib.sites',
                'django.contrib.messages',
                'django.contrib.staticfiles',
                # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
                # 'django.contrib.admin',
                # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation:
                # 'django.contrib.admindocs',
