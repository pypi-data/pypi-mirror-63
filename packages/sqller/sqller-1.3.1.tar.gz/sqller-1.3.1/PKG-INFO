        ## Installing
        
        At first, you need SQLite3 to be installed. Type following in your terminal:

        apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
        ```
        
        To install the package type the following in your terminal:
        
        ```bash
        sudo pip install sqller
        ```
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        To run tests type the following in your terminal:
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m pytest
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```bash
        python -m pytest
        ```
        
        if the previous command doesn't work.
