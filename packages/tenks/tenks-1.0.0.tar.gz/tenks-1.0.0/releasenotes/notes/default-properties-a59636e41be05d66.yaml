    Adds support for setting default properties on ironic nodes. This avoids an
    issue where nodes are registered with the standard scheduling properties
    all set to 1, causing ironic validation failures. See `story 2004908
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2004908>`__ for details.
