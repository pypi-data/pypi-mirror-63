        Tenks is a utility that manages virtual bare metal clusters for development and
        testing purposes. It offers:
        
        * Declarative definition of clusters using Ansible's familiar YAML
          syntax
        
        * Automated creation and deletion of virtualised bare metal nodes across any
          number of hypervisors
        
        * In-built management of Open vSwitch bridges for physical networks
        
        * Registration of nodes and ports with OpenStack Ironic, and creation of
          OpenStack Nova flavors
        
        * Simple cluster reconfiguration and tear-down
        
        To get started with Tenks, see the documentation (linked below).
