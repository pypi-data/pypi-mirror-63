# dotnet4

Microsoft .NET (dotnet) behaves as a package on some versions of the Microsoft
Operating System, and as an update/hotfix on other versions of the Microsoft OS.
The Salt package manager for Windows handles software packages just fine, but
currently does not understand Windows updates or hotfixes.

This salt formula incorporates logic to check whether the specified version of
.NET 4 has already been installed as a Windows hotfix. The mapping of .NET
version to a Hotfix ID is done via a lookup table in map.jinja. If the hotfix
is not present, and if the OS version treats .NET as an update, the formula
uses the module.run state to install the .NET package. If the OS version treats
.NET as a software package, the formula uses the pkg.install state to install
the .NET package.

**Versions of the Microsoft OS known to treat .NET 4 as a hotfix**:
- Microsoft Windows 8.1
- Microsoft Windows 10
- Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2
- Microsoft Windows Server 2016
- Microsoft Windows Server 2019

**Versions of the Microsoft OS known to treat .NET 4 as a software package**:
- Microsoft Windows 2008 R2

Other versions of the Microsoft OS have not been tested.

variable, the version of .NET to install. Below is an example of a complete
pillar configuration:
