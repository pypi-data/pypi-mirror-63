### wesutils
This is a collection of utility functions that I use repeatedly when building
and running empirical tests for my research. At the moment, this mostly
consists of creating simple `pytorch` models, saving and loading models,
and logging experiment data, as well as implementations of reinforcement
learning algorithms.
