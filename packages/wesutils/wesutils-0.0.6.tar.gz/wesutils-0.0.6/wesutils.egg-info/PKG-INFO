Description: ### wesutils
        This is a collection of utility functions that I use repeatedly when building
        and running empirical tests for my research. At the moment, this mostly
        consists of creating simple `pytorch` models, saving and loading models,
        and logging experiment data, as well as implementations of reinforcement
        learning algorithms.
