Python LabVIEW Automation (labview_automation)
==============================================

Python LabVIEW Automation labview_automation is a Python package to make it
easy to call LabVIEW VirtualInstruments (VIs) from Python.  It includes a
Pythonic interface to call VIs and a class to interact with LabVIEW executables
on Windows.

To facilitate this interaction LabVIEW is started with a VI that listens for
tcp messages.  The Python interface sends BSON (see bsonspec.org) encoded
messages to the VI which then performs the commands.

LabVIEW can be started on a remote machine using hoplite.  Since the interface
between Python and LabVIEW is tcp the messages can be sent to another machine.

Note on Security
----------------
Python LabVIEW Automation opens a TCP port and does not have any secure protocols currently implemented.

Support
-------
Python LabVIEW Automation is not supported by National Instruments.

Installation
------------
This package depends on hoplite.  First install hoplite.  When/if hoplite
is added to PyPI then this manual step will not be needed.

labview_automation can be installed by cloning the master branch and then
in a command line in the directory of setup.py run:

    pip install --pre .


Simple Local Example
--------------------
You can set controls on the front panel of the VIs that you execute by adding
members to a dictionary where each member represents a different control of
the given name.  Controls can be numerics, strings, booleans, arrays, or
clusters of the same types.

`run_vi_synchronous` runs the VI synchronously and returns a dictionary of
all the indicators on the VI.  

    from labview_automation import LabVIEW
    lv = LabVIEW()
    lv.start() # Launches the active LabVIEW with the listener VI
    with lv.client() as c:
        control_values = {
            "DBL Control": 5.0,
            "String Control": "Hello World!",
            "Error In": {
                "status": False,
                "code": 0,
                "source": ""
            }
        }
        indicators = c.run_vi_synchronous(
            vi_path, control_values)
        print(indicators['Result'])
        error_message = c.describe_error(indicators['Error Out'])
    lv.kill() # Stop LabVIEW

Development
-----------
All LabVIEW code is developed using LabVIEW 2014 SP1 x86.
