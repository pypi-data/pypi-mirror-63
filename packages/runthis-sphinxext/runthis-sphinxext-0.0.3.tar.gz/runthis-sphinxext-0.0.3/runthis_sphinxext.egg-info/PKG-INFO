Description: # runthis-sphinxext
        This provides a sphinx extension that adds RunThis code blocks,
        which display a highligthed code-block statically, but with a
        "RunThis" button above them. When the button is clicked, the code
        block is replaced by a terminal session that has executed that
        code.
        
        ## Installation
        RunThis Sphinx Extention may be installed with either conda or pip:
        
        ```sh
        # use the conda-forge channel
        $ conda install -c conda-forge runthis-sphinxext
        
        # Or you can use Pip, if you must.
        $ pip install runthis-sphinxext
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        To use the RunThis code blocks, you must configure sphinx to know about
        RunThis. First, make sure the sphinx extension is registered. In the
        `conf.py`, add `runthis.sphinxext` somewhere in the extensions block:
        
        ```python
        extensions = [
            ...
            "runthis.sphinxext",
            ...
        ]
        ```
        
        After this, you also need to tell sphinx where the RunThis Server is
        located.  This can be set with the `runthis_server` variable anywhere
        in the `conf.py`.  For example:
        
        ```python
        # runthis options
        runthis_server = "http://localhost:5000"
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To use the RunThis directive is very similar to the `code-block`
        directive in rST. In any of your `*.rst` files, you may use
        the `runthis` directive, followed by the language name on the
        same line.  After any `code-block` options and one or more blank lines,
        the code that you wish to display and run, is in an indented block.
        For example:
        
        ```rst
        .. runthis:: python
        
            import sys
            print(sys.executable)
        ```
        
        This will be run on the remote server specified in the `conf.py` file.
