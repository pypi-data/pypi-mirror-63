        ## Features
        
        The BidFX Python API is a *pricing* and *trading* API that connects to
        the BidFX platform to subscribe to realtime pricing and to place orders.
        The API supports:
        
         - FX request for stream (RFS) pricing
         - FX request for quote (RFQ) pricing
         - FX and Futures trading with
            [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) or 
            [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).
        
        ## Python Version
        
        The API is compatible with Python 3.6 and greater.

        or refer to the [Installing Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) section 
        of the Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python.
