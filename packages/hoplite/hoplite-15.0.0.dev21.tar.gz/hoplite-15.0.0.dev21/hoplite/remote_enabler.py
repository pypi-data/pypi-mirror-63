    Decorator which can be used to add remote capabilities to functions or
    classes.

    By using this decorator on a function, the module which contains the
    function will be given two additional functions which provide the means
    for calling the function on a remote machine running Hoplite. The names of
    these two functions are remote\_(name of original function) and
    remote_async\_(name of original function). The remote\_function calls the
    function or method asynchronously on the remote machine, and the
    remote_async\_ function returns an object which can be used to run the
    function asynchronously on the remote machine.

    By using this decorator on a class, the class will be enhanced with
    remote\_ and remote_async\_ methods which serve the same purpose as the
    remote\_ and remote_async\_ functions described above.

    In either case, documentation will be added to the new functions/methods
    giving a short description of how to use them and a link to the original
    function. This feature can be disabled by passing in False for the
    add_documentation parameter.

    For additional details, see the above documentation and examples.

    :param module_name: The namespace for the module which contains this class
      or function. This should simply be passed in as __name__
      (e.g. @remotify(__name__)
    :type module_name: str
    :param functions: A list of names of the methods which should be made
      remotable. This only applies when decorating classes. If no list is
      provided, then all methods in the class (besides those starting with __)
      will be made remotable
    :param add_documentation: If true, then the functions or methods which are
      added will be given documentation explaining how they are to be used, and
      linking to the original function. If false, then they will be given no
      documentation, though they will still show up in the Sphinx documentation
      if the associated rst file indicates that undocumented functions/methods
      should be included

class RemoteEnablerMetaClass(type):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 15.0.0.dev25
       Use the :ref:`remotify decorator <remotify>` instead

    Add remote capabilities to a class.

    If a class opts to use this as its metaclass, then every function in the
    class (besides those starting with __) will be enhanced to allow for remote
    operation through hoplite. As an example, if there is a function defined
    as::

        def do_stuff(self, input_1, input_2):
            ...

    Then two additional functions will be added to the class::

        def remote_do_stuff(self, remote_machine_address, *args, **kwargs):
            ...

        def remote_async_do_stuff(self, remote_machine_address, *args, **kwargs)
            ...

    In these new functions, \*args and \*\*kwargs represent all of the
    arguments required by the original function. "remote_machine_address" is
    the IP address or hostname of the machine on which the function will be
    run remotely. If the remote machine is running Hoplite on a port other
    than the default (5000), then "remote_machine_address" can be given in the
    form "address:port"

    When the remote_do_stuff function is called, hoplite will attempt to
    connect to the Hoplite server on the remote machine and run the function
    on it, using the current state of the object on the local machine. In
    other words, it should seem as if the function is running on the local
    machine, except that the operations themselves will affect *only* the
    remote machine. In particular, if the function being run remotely changes
    the class instance, those changes will not be reflected on the local
    machine. This must be kept in mind when creating classes that will be made
    remotable - any changes of state must be sent back to the local machine as
    return values. That includes reference variables passed as function
    parameters that would normally not need to be returned.

    When the remote_async_do_stuff function is called, a RemoteAsyncJobWrapper
    object will be returned which can be used to start the function
    asynchronously. This object implements the same public functions as the
    RemoteJob class, and so can be used in the same way. When the function is
    run, it operates in the same way as the remote_do_stuff function does,
    except that it is run asynchronously. This means that any exceptions which
    occur will not be raised until the job status is checked.

    In cases where inheritance is used in a class, the behavior is governed by
    the following rules:

    - For each class which uses the metaclass, if it inherits from another
    class then that parent class must either use the metaclass as well (in
    which case all of its functions will be made available to the child as
    remotable functions) or the parent class must be a new-style class
    (inherit from "object"), in which case its functions will not be
    available to the child as remotable functions. If the parent class does
    not use the metaclass, and if it is not a new-style class, then a TypeError
    will be raised due to some technical issues with metaclasses and
    inheritance.

    - If a class uses the metaclass, then all classes which inherit from it
    (i.e. all of its descendants) will be made remotable. In other words, if a
    parent class uses the metaclass, then it as well as its child will be made
    remotable. The parent will have access to all its own functions as
    remotable functions, and the child will have access not only to all of its
    own functions, but also all of the parent's functions, as remotable
    functions. This holds true for all descendants.
