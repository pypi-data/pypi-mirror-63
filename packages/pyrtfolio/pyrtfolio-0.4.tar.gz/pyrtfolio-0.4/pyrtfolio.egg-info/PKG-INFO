        ## Introduction
        
        **pyrtfolio** is a Python package created based on [investpy](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy) data which
        aims to create custom stock portfolios. In investment, a portfolio is a grouping of financial assets as well as their
        fund counterparts; note that a portfolio can also consist of non-publicly tradable securities. So on, **investpy** data 
        will be used to create custom portfolios from the data provided by the user such as the asset symbol, purchase date, 
        number of bought shares, etc.
        
        ## Installation
        
        In order to get this package working you will need to install **pyrtfolio** via pip by typing the following 
        command in the terminal:
        
        ``$ pip install pyrtfolio==0.4``
        
        Every package used is listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/alvarobartt/pyrtfolio/blob/master/requirements.txt) 
        file, which can also be installed via pip:
        
        ``$ pip install -r requirements.txt``
        
        ## Usage
        
        Currently, **pyrtfolio** can just be used for generating stock portfolios, so on, an example is proposed below
        which creates a new portfolio and adds some equities/stocks. Note that the returned portfolio is a :obj:`pandas.DataFrame`,
        but the package is intended to generate either a CVS or a XLSX file.
        
        ```python
        from pyrtfolio.StockPortfolio import StockPortfolio
        
        portfolio = StockPortfolio()
        
        portfolio.add_stock(stock_symbol='BBVA',
                            stock_country='spain',
                            purchase_date='04/01/2018',
                            num_of_shares=2,
                            cost_per_share=7.2)
        
        portfolio.add_stock(stock_aymbol='ELE',
                            stock_country='spain',
                            purchase_date='13/06/2019',
                            num_of_shares=15,
                            cost_per_share=23.8)
                            
        print(portfolio.data)
        ```
        ```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
