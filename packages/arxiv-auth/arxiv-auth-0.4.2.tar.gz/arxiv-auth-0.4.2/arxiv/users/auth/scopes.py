"""
Authorization scopes for arXiv users and clients.

The concept of authorization scope comes from OAuth 2.0 (`RFC 6749 ยง3.3
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3>`_). For a nice primer, see
`this blog post <https://brandur.org/oauth-scope>`_. The basic idea is that
the authorization associated with an access token can be limited, e.g. to
limit what actions an API client can take on behalf of a user.

In this package, the scope concept is applied to both API client and end-user
sessions. When the session is created, we consult the relevant bits of data in
our system (e.g. what roles the user has, what privileges are associated with
those roles) to determine what the user is authorized to do. Those privileges
are attached to the user's session as authorization scopes.

This module simply defines a set of constants (str) that can be used to refer
to specific authorization scopes. Rather than refer to scopes by writing new
str objects, these constants should be imported and used. This improves the
semantics of code, and reduces the risk of programming errors. For an example,
see :mod:`arxiv.users.auth.decorators`.
