The Descartes Labs Platform simplifies analysis of **global-scale raster data** by providing:

  * Access to a catalog of petabytes of disparate geospatial data,
    all normalized and interoperable through one **common interface**
  * **Infrastructure** to parallelize any code across thousands of machines co-located with that data
  * The ability to **add new data to that catalog**-whether the output of analysis on existing data,
    or from a proprietary source-which can then be used as an input for more analysis
  * A Python client library to access these systems
  * Web interfaces to `browse this catalog <https://catalog.descarteslabs.com/>`_
    and `view imagery <https://viewer.descarteslabs.com/>`_, including your data you create
