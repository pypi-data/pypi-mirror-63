# Larkspur

A simple scalable bloom filter implementation, inspired by previous related work.
The goal of this project is not to be the best possible Redis-backed bloom filter,
but to be a good-enough Redis-backed bloom filter.

If you want the best possible Redis-backed bloom filter, you should consider
using the Redisbloom module of RedisLabs' Redis Enterprise Software.

## Name

It's called Larkspur because the name is shared by a species of bird as well as a flower (bloom).
This project was originally created to serve a need at Feathr (www.feathr.co) and we
try to name all our projects along an avian theme.
