This first include should fail--
because include paths are relative *to the source document*,
not the included document,
this will result in an attempted circular import
and show nothing between the end of this text and the &lt;hr>:

<pre class=include>
path: include004-files/include004.bs
</pre>

<hr>

This second include should work,
and report success:

<pre class=include>
path: include004-files/include004-2.bs
</pre>
