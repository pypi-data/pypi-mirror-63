Let |var| be a string.

Reverse |var| and return the result.

Here's |a|, a single char.

Here's |ab|, two chars.

Here's |abc|, three chars.

Here's some grammar: foo | bar | baz | qux

Here's some more: foo || bar || baz || qux

Here's |foo bar|, multi word.

Here's |foo-bar|, dashed.

Here's a "real" <var>foo bar</var>.

Here's one with a linebreak: <var>foo
bar with a linebreak</var>.

This one has no linebreak: |foo bar with a linebreak|. This shouldn't generate a warning.
