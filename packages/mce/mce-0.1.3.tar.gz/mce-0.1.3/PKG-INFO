Description: # Mechanical Compound Eye
        Is a python based Nvidia DeepStream app to watch multiple video streams at once.
        
        ## Requirements
        - **DeepStream 4.0** (this can be installed on a Tegra platform since JetPack 
        4.3 with `sudo apt install deepstream-4.0`)
        - [Python bindings for DeepStream](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_python_apps/blob/master/HOWTO.md#running-sample-applications)
        
        ## Installation
        ```shell
        pip3 install (git url)
        ```
        or
        ```shell
        pip3 install mce
        ```
        or if you don't have pip / don't want to install it
        ```shell
        (git clone this url)
        cd mce
        python3 ./setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Example Usage:
        
        To run detections on multiple youtube videos/playlists (requires youtube-dl which can be installed with `pip3 install youtube-dl`):
        ```
        mce $(youtube-dl -f best -g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ5cg83D5AE) $(youtube-dl -f best -g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peC1JD9gEKc) $(youtube-dl -f best -g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LYE669fbpU)
        ```
        
        Any uri supported by uridecodebin should work.
        
        ## Faq
        - **Did you come up with the name?** [No](https://genius.com/Meshuggah-the-demons-name-is-surveillance-lyrics).
        - **How can I customize this?** The primary inference config is in ~/.mce/pie.conf
        
        ## Known Issues
        - tests need to be written
        - the decoder spews warning messages... not sure why
        - videos don't always play at the correct rate. the --live option may help with some sources
        - nvinfer doesn't respect batch-engine-file set at runtime for loading a file,
        leading to long start times.
