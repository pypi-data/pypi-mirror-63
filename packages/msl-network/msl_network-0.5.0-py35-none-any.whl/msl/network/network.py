        All devices on the network must be able to identify themselves to any
        other device that is connected to the network. There are 3 possible types
        of network devices -- a :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`,
        a :class:`~msl.network.service.Service` and a :class:`~msl.network.client.Client`.
        The member names and JSON_ datatype for each network device is described below.

        * :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`

            hostname: string
                The name of the device that the Network :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`
                is running on.

            port: integer
                The port number that the Network :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`
                is running on.

            attributes: object
                An object (a Python :class:`dict`) of public attributes that the Network
                :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager` provides. Users who are an administrator of
                the Network :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager` can access private attributes.

            language: string
                The programming language that the Network :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`
                is running on.

            os: string
                The name of the operating system that the :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`
                is running on.

            clients: object
                An object (a Python :class:`dict`) of all :class:`~msl.network.client.Client` devices
                that are currently connected to the Network :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`.

            services: object
                An object (a Python :class:`dict`) of all :class:`~msl.network.service.Service` devices
                that are currently connected to the Network :class:`~msl.network.manager.Manager`.

        * :class:`~msl.network.service.Service`

            type: string
                This must be equal to ``'service'`` (case-insensitive).

            name: string
                The name to associate with the :class:`~msl.network.service.Service`
                (can contain spaces).

            attributes: object
                An object (a Python :class:`dict`) of the attributes that the
                :class:`~msl.network.service.Service` provides. The keys are
                the function names and the values are the function signatures
                (expressed as a string).

                The `attributes` get populated automatically when subclassing
                :class:`~msl.network.service.Service`. If you are creating a
                `Service` in another programming language then you can use the
                following as an example for how to define an `attributes` object::

                    {
                        'pi': '() -> float'
                        'add_integers': '(x:int, y:int) -> int'
                        'scalar_multiply': '(a:float, data:*float) -> *float'
                    }

                This `Service` would provide a function named ``pi`` that takes no
                inputs and returns a floating-point number, a function named
                ``add_integers`` that takes parameters named ``x`` and ``y`` as integer
                inputs and returns an integer, and a function named ``scalar_multiply``
                that takes parameters named ``a`` as a floating-point number and ``data``
                as an array of floating-point numbers as inputs and returns an array of
                floating-point numbers.

                The key **must** be equal to the name of the function that the
                `Service` provides, however, the value (the function signature) is only
                used as a helpful guide to let a :class:`~msl.network.client.Client` know
                what the function takes as inputs and what the function returns. How you
                express the function signature is up to you. The above example could
                also be expressed as::

                    {
                        'pi': '() -> 3.1415926...'
                        'add_integers': '(x:int32, y:int32) -> x+y'
                        'scalar_multiply': '(a:float, data:array of floats) -> array of floats'
                    }

            language: string, optional
                The programming language that the :class:`~msl.network.service.Service`
                is running on.

            os: string, optional
                The name of the operating system that the :class:`~msl.network.service.Service`
                is running on.

            max_clients: integer, optional
                The maximum number of :class:`~msl.network.client.Client`\\s that can be
                linked with the :class:`~msl.network.service.Service`. If the value is
                :math:`\\leq` 0 then that means that an unlimited number of
                :class:`~msl.network.client.Client`\\s can be linked
                *(this is the default setting if max_clients is not specified)*.

        * :class:`~msl.network.client.Client`

            type: string
                This must be equal to ``'client'`` (case-insensitive).

            name: string
                The name to associate with the :class:`~msl.network.client.Client`
