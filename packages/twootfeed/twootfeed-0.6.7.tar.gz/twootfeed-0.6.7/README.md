The RSS feed displays only the original tweets (not the retweets) and toots, with:
- links to :  
  - the tweet on Twitter or toot on Mastodon  
  - hashtags  
  - usernames  
- URLs 
- images
- source
- location (only for Twitter)
- numbers of retweets and likes for tweets and boosts and favourites for toots
