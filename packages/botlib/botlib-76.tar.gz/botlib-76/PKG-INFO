        BOTLIB is a library you can use to program bots. no copyright. no LICENSE.
        
        as of version 76 the binaries in the tarball are no longer distributed with the egg.
        this makes this package a pure library package e.g. no binaries. program your own clientcode with it, see http://pypi.org/project/genoclaim
        
        
        I N S T A L L
        
        
        download the tarball from pypi, https://pypi.org/project/botlib/#files
        
        if you want to have BOTLIB started at boot, you need to have the tarball and run:
        
        ::
        
         > sudo bin/install
        
        this will install an botd service in /etc/systemd/system
        
        
        you can also download with pip3 and install globally.
        
        ::
        
         > sudo pip3 install botlib --upgrade --force-reinstall
        
        
        U S A G E
        
        
        ::
        
         > bin/bot localhost \#dunkbots botje
         > bin/botsh
         > bin/botd 
         > bin/botcmd <cmd>
         > bin/botctl <cmd>
        
        logfiles can be found in ~/.bot/logs.
        
        
        C O N F I G U R A T I O N
        
        
        use botctl to edit on the system installed botd service:
        
        ::
        
         > bin/botctl cfg krn modules bot.rss,bot.udp
         > bin/botctl cfg irc server localhost
         > bin/botctl cfg irc channel #dunkbots
         > bin/botctl cfg irc nick botje
         > bin/botctl meet ~bart@127.0.0.1
         > bin/botctl rss rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
        
        use the -w option if you want to use a different work directory then ~/.bot.
        
        
        R S S
        
        
        add an url:
        
        ::
        
         > bin/botctl rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
         ok 1
        
         run the rss command to see what urls are registered:
        
         > bin/botctl rss
         0 https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
        
         the fetch command can be used to poll the added feeds:
        
         > bin/botctl fetch
         fetched 0
        
        
        U D P
        
        
        using udp to relay text into a channel, start the bot with -m bot.udp and use
        the botudp program to send text via the bot to the channel on the irc server:
        
        ::
        
         > tail -f /var/log/botd/botd.log | bin/botudp 
        
        
        C O D I N G
        
        if you want to develop on the library clone the source at bitbucket.org:
        
        ::
        
         > git clone https://bitbucket.org/botd/botlib
         > cd botlib
         > sudo python3 setup.py install
        
        if you want to add your own modules to the bot, you can put you .py files in a "mods" directory and use the -m option to point to that directory.
        
        BOTLIB contains the following modules:
        
        ::
        
            bot.dft		- default
            bot.flt		- fleet
            bot.irc		- irc bot
            bot.krn		- core handler
            bot.rss		- rss to channel
            bot.shw		- show runtime
            bot.udp		- udp to channel
            bot.usr		- users
        
        BOTLIB uses the LIBOBJ library which gets included in the tarball.
        
        ::
        
            lo.clk		- clock
            lo.csl		- console 
            lo.hdl		- handler
            lo.shl		- shell
            lo.thr		- threads
            lo.tms		- times
            lo.typ		- types
        
        basic code is a function that gets an event as a argument:
        
        ::
        
         def command(event):
             << your code here >>
        
        to give feedback to the user use the event.reply(txt) method:
        
        ::
        
         def command(event):
             event.reply("yooo %s" % event.origin)
        
        
        have fun coding ;]
