Description: GroupLasso
        ========================
        
        Group Lasso package for Python.
        
        
        ## Installation Guide
        
        ### Using pip
        
        The easiest way to install GroupLasso is using `pip`
        
        ```
        pip install GroupLasso
        ```
        
        ### Building from source
        
        Run the following commands:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/AnchorBlues/GroupLasso.git
        cd GroupLasso
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Getting started
        Here is the `GroupLassoRegressor` model:
        
        ```python
        from grouplasso import GroupLassoRegressor
        ```
        
        Create sample dataset:
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        np.random.seed(0)
        X = np.random.randn(10, 3)
        # target variable is strongly correlated with 0th feature.
        y = X[:, 0] + np.random.randn(10) * 0.1
        ```
        
        Set group_ids, which specify group membership:
        ```python
        # 0th feature and 1st feature are the same group.
        group_ids = np.array([0, 0, 1])
        ```
        
        You can now train Group Lasso:
        ```python
        model = GroupLassoRegressor(group_ids=group_ids, random_state=42, verbose=False, alpha=1e-1)
        model.fit(X, y)
        ```
        
        Note that all the members of a particular group are either selected(`coef_ != 0`) or not selected(`coef_ == 0`).
        ```python
        model.coef_
        # array([ 0.84795715, -0.01193528, -0.        ])
        ```
