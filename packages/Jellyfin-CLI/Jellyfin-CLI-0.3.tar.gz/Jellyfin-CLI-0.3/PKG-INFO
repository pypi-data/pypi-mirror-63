        ### How to use
        This app requires Python3.6 or higher  
        You can install it by executing `pip3 install --user jellyfin-cli`  
        The first time you run it, you will be greeted by a minimalist login prompt. This will repeat every time the token is invalidated.
        After that you can use the interface. Everything except music works.  
        Player-wise MPV and VLC are supported out of the box but typically any player that supports network streaming (and that doesn't require any flags) will work. You can specify a custom player path through the `PLAYER_PATH` environment variable.
