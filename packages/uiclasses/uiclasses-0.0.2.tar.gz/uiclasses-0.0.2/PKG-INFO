        - Powered by `Python 3 Data Classes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.
        - Objects optimized for user interfaces.
        - Methods to traverse nested dicts, convert to and from json
        - ModelList and ModelSet collections for robust manipulation of collections of models.
        - No I/O happens in models.
        - Collections can be easily cached to leverage responsive user interfaces.
        
        
        
        Installation
        ============

           pip install uiclasses
        
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from uiclasses import Model
        
        
           class BlogPost(Model):
               id: int
               title: str
               body: str
        
        
           post1 = BlogPost({"id": 1, "title": "title 1", "body": "body 1", "wimsical_extra_field": "lala land"})
           post2 = BlogPost(id=2, title="title 2", body="body 2", extradata='stored but invisible')
        
           published = BlogPost.List([post1, post2])

        Notes:
        ======
        
        
        - This is not designed to be fast, when adding data to models their
          types might cast and validated, which is costly.
          - filtering collections by string values cause glob match
