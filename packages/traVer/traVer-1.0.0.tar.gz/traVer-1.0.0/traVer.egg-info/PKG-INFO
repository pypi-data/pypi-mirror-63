Description: # TraVersion
        TraVersion is similar way of maintaining semantic versioning in python, where the major points are introduced in this repository.
        
        **Usage Example:**
        * Default version
            ```python
            from traVer import Version
            version = Version()
            
            # Default version will be 1.0.0
            print(version)
            ```
          _Output:_
            ```bash
            >> 1.0.0
            ```
        * Assigning version
            ```python
            from traVer import Version
            version = Version("2.3.4-beta.5")
            
            # You can specify major, minor, patch, preRelName, preRelease
            print(version.major)
            print(version.patch)
            ```
            _Output:_
            ```bash
            >> 2
            4
          ```
        **Note:**
        
           Anyone interested to contribute code or give some ideas to improve the versions to this repository are most welcome.
