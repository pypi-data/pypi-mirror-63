Methcomp is a Python visualization library based and built on `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_. It provides a high-level interface for method comparison for clinical chemisty methods, amongst others.
Here is some of the functionality that methcomp currently offers:
- Method comparison using Bland-Altman plots;
- Method comparison using regression techniques such as Passing-Bablok, Deming and simple linear regression;
- Method comparison for glucose sensors using Clarke and Parkes error grids.
