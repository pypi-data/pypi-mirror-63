Description: # ahoi (A Horrible Optimisation Instrument)
        
        This module contains a few python functions to run Brute-force scans for rectangular cut optimization.
        
        # Installation
        
        To install ahoi run
        
        ```sh
        python3 -m pip install [--user] ahoi
        ```
        
        Use `--user` if not in a virtual environment or conda environment.
        
        It's recommended to use python3, but currently python2 is also supported.
        
        # Example
        The basic functionality uses a `masks_list` which is a list of lists or a list
        of 2D numpy arrays that represent pass flags for selection criteria.
        
        For example, the following represents pass flags for the criteria `>0`, `>0.1`,
        `>0.2`, ..., `>0.9` for 5 random uniform variables in 10000 events:
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        np.random.seed(42)
        x = np.random.rand(10000, 5)
        masks_list = [[x[:,i] > v for v in np.linspace(0, 0.9, 10)] for i in range(x.shape[1])]
        ```
        
        To count all matching combinations for all criteria on each variable run
        
        ```
        import ahoi
        counts = ahoi.scan(masks_list)
        ```
        
        The entry `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` of `counts` will contain the number of matching
        events where the first column of `x` is `>0`, the second one `>0.1`, the third
        one `>0.2` etc.
        
        ```python
        >>> counts[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        3032
        >>> np.count_nonzero((x[:,0] > 0) & (x[:,1] > 0.1) & (x[:,2] > 0.2) & (x[:,3] > 0.3) & (x[:,4] > 0.4))
        3032
        ```
        
        You can also pass weights
        
        ```python
        weights = np.random.normal(loc=1, size=len(x))
        counts, sumw, sumw2 = ahoi.scan(masks_list, weights=weights)
        ```
        
        The arrays `sumw` and `sumw2` will contain the sum of weights and sum of squares
        of weights for matching combinations. The sum of squares of weights can be used
        to estimate the statistical uncertainty on the sum of weights ($`\sigma = \sqrt{\sum w_i^2}`$).
        
        ```python
        >>> sumw[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        3094.2191136427627
        >>> np.dot(
        ...     (x[:,0] > 0) & (x[:,1] > 0.1) & (x[:,2] > 0.2) & (x[:,3] > 0.3) & (x[:,4] > 0.4),
        ...     weights
        ... )
        3094.219113642755
        >>> np.sqrt(sumw2[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
        78.5528532026876
        >>> np.sqrt(
        ...     np.dot(
        ...         (x[:,0] > 0) & (x[:,1] > 0.1) & (x[:,2] > 0.2) & (x[:,3] > 0.3) & (x[:,4] > 0.4),
        ...         weights ** 2
        ...     )
        ... )
        78.55285320268761
        ```
        
        # Tutorial/Notebook
        Have a look at the [examples](examples) for a tutorial that explains how to use
        this for solving a classification problem.
        
        # Tests/Coverage
        
        Run the tests and coverage report inside the project directory with
        
        ```sh
        python3 -m pytest --cov=ahoi --doctest-modules
        coverage html
        ```
