You can give this command an alias to simplify the it:   
Add the following line to you bashrc  
> Usually `~/.bashrc` (current user) or `/etc/bashrc` (global); if you use Git For Windows, it's `/etc/bash.bashrc`
```
alias ssh-connect='python -m ssh-connect'
```
Then you can use the command
```
eval $(ssh-connect)
```
The command finds the first existing ssh agent and connect it.  
> Note: If you have more than one ssh agent running in the background, which agent that would be connected is undefined.
