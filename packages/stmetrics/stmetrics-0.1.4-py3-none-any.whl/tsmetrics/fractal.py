    DFA measures the Hurst parameter H, which is very similar to the Hurst exponent. 
    The main difference is that DFA can be used for non-stationary processes (whose mean and/or variance change over time).

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : list or numpy.array
        One dimensional time series.
    Returns

def hurst_exp(series):

    Hurst exponent.
    Hurst Exponent is a self-similarity measure that assess long-range dependence in a time series.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    series : list or numpy.array
        One dimensional time series.
    Returns
    -------
    hurst : float
        Hurst exponent.
    
    The hurst exponent is a measure of the “long-term memory” of a time series. 
    It can be used to determine whether the time series is more, less, or equally likely to increase if it has increased in previous steps. 
    This property makes the Hurst exponent especially interesting for the analysis of stock data.
