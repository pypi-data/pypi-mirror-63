        Produce reliable land use and land cover maps to support the deployment and operation of public policies is a necessity, especially when environmental management and economic development are considered. To increase the accuracy of these maps, satellite image time-series have been used, as they allow the understanding of land cover dynamics through the time.
        
        The stmetrics, is a python package that provides the extraction of state-of-the-art time-series features. These features can be used for remote sensing time-series image classification and analysis.
