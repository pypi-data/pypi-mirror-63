Description: # piXnotify
        
        This project is an attempt to build a cross-platform notification library in python.
        
        It heavily relies on platform-dependant notification libraries, namely 
        
        - [pync](https://github.com/SeTeM/pync)
        - [notify2](https://notify2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        
        You could also use [plyer](https://github.com/kivy/plyer/tree/master/plyer) project which aims to provide a whole set of cross platform features such as notifications, camera manipulation ...
        
        ## Setup
        
        Run 
        ```
        pip install .
        ``` 
        or 
        ```
        python setup.py sdist
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        This will install platform-specific python packages, specified in python.py .
        
        ## Usage
        
        Typical package usage will be:
        
        ```
        from piXnotify import notifier
        
        notifier.setTitle("Title").setMessage("message").notify()
        ```
