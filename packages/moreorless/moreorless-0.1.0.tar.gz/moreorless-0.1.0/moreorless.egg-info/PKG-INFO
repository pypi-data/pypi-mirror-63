Description: # morelorless
        
        This is a thin wrapper around `difflib.unified_diff` that Does The Right Thing
        for "No newline at eof".  The args are also simplified compared to `difflib`:
        
        ```
        moreorless.unified_diff(
            astr: str,
            bstr: str,
            filename: str,
            n: int = 3,
        ) -> str
        ```
