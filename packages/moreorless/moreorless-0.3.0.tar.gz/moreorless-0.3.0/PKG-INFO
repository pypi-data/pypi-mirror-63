Description: # morelorless
        
        This is a thin wrapper around `difflib.unified_diff` that Does The Right Thing
        for "No newline at eof".  The args are also simplified compared to `difflib`:
        
        ```
        moreorless.unified_diff(
            astr: str,
            bstr: str,
            filename: str,
            n: int = 3,
        ) -> str
        
        # raises moreorless.patch.PatchException
        moreorless.patch.apply_single_file(
            contents: str,
            patch: str,
            allow_offsets: bool = True,
        ) -> str
        
        # uses click to write to stdout with colors
        moreorless.click.echo_color_unified_diff(
            astr: str,
            bstr: str,
            filename: str,
            n: int = 3
        ) -> None
        ```
