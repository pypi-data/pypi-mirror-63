# Todo

## Docs
* Build READMEs, guides, and source docs.
* Unify docs w.r.t. code references ``(e.g. :py:meth:\`~api.RestApi\`)``
* Host on readthedocs.

## Type-hinting
* Redo everything, make use of TypeVar/Generic where needed.
* Investigate proper packaging for source + type-hints.
* Probably use stubs for earlier compatibility.

## Unit-tests
* Finish conversion to `pytest` and `responses`.
* Provide coverage report.
* Implement CI.
